Robustness is of particular\nconcern in responsible AI, especially for safety-critical applications. In this\npaper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the robustness of ChatGPT from the\nadversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective. To do so, we employ the\nAdvGLUE and ANLI benchmarks to assess adversarial robustness and the Flipkart\nreview and DDXPlus medical diagnosis datasets for OOD evaluation.

As such, there has been an\nincreased focus on making Transformer models more efficient, with methods that\nrange from changing the architecture design, all the way to developing\ndedicated domain-specific accelerators. In this work, we survey different\napproaches for efficient Transformer inference, including: (i) analysis and\nprofiling of the bottlenecks in existing Transformer architectures and their\nsimilarities and differences with previous convolutional models; (ii)\nimplications of Transformer architecture on hardware, including the impact of\nnon-linear operations such as Layer Normalization, Softmax, and GELU, as well\nas linear operations, on hardware design; (iii) approaches for optimizing a\nfixed Transformer architecture; (iv) challenges in finding the right mapping\nand scheduling of operations for Transformer models; and (v) approaches for\noptimizing Transformer models by adapting the architecture using neural\narchitecture search.

One way to reduce the risk of\nLLMs generating undesired discourses is to alter the training of the LLM. This\ncan be very restrictive due to demanding computation requirements. Other\nmethods rely on rule-based or prompt-based token elimination, which are limited\nas they dismiss future tokens and the overall meaning of the complete\ndiscourse. Here, we center detoxification on the probability that the finished\ndiscourse is ultimately considered toxic. That is, at each point, we advise\nagainst token selections proportional to how likely a finished text from this\npoint will be toxic. To this end, we formally extend the dead-end theory from\nthe recent reinforcement learning (RL) literature to also cover uncertain\noutcomes. Our approach, called rectification, utilizes a separate but\nsignificantly smaller model for detoxification, which can be applied to diverse\nLLMs as long as they share the same vocabulary. Importantly, our method does\nnot require access to the internal representations of the LLM, but only the\ntoken probability distribution at each decoding step.

Nonetheless, these methods are either\nfounded on hand-picked model generations that are favored by human annotators,\nrendering them ineffective in terms of data utilization and challenging to\napply in general, or they depend on reward functions and reinforcement\nlearning, which are prone to imperfect reward function and extremely\nchallenging to optimize. In this work, we propose a novel technique, Chain of\nHindsight, that is easy to optimize and can learn from any form of feedback,\nregardless of its polarity. Our idea is inspired by how humans learn from\nextensive feedback presented in the form of languages. We convert all types of\nfeedback into sentences, which are then used to fine-tune the model, allowing\nus to take advantage of the language comprehension capabilities of language\nmodels. We condition the model on a sequence of model generations paired with\nfeedback. By doing so, models are trained to generate outputs based on\nfeedback, and models can learn to identify and correct negative attributes or\nerrors. Applying our method to large language models, we observed that Chain of\nHindsight significantly surpasses previous methods in aligning language models\nwith human preferences. We observed significant improvements on summarization\nand dialogue tasks and our approach is markedly preferred in human evaluations.\n","authors":["Hao Liu","Carmelo Sferrazza","Pieter Abbeel"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02676v4.pdf","comment":"Added more ablation studies and released code"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12832v1","updated":"2023-02-27T15:54:57Z","published":"2023-02-27T15:54:57Z","title":"Fluid Transformers and Creative Analogies: Exploring Large Language\n  Models' Capacity for Augmenting Cross-Domain Analogical Creativity","summary":"  Cross-domain analogical reasoning is a core creative ability that can be\nchallenging for humans.

To address this challenge, we propose a transformer\nbased cross-modal mutual learning framework to prompt multi-modal interaction.\nCompared with the vanilla self-attention, our model forces modality-specific\ninformation of different modalities to pass through a modality-invariant\ncodebook, collating linguistic representations for tokens of each modality.\nThen the shared linguistic knowledge is used to re-synchronize multi-modal\nsequences. Moreover, we establish a novel large-scale multi-speaker CS dataset\nfor Mandarin Chinese. To our knowledge, this is the first work on ACSR for\nMandarin Chinese. Extensive experiments are conducted for different languages\ni.e., Chinese, French, and British English). Results demonstrate that our model\nexhibits superior recognition performance to the state-of-the-art by a large\nmargin.\n","authors":["Lei Liu","Li Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01083v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted to ICASSP2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13512v1","updated":"2023-02-27T04:24:13Z","published":"2023-02-27T04:24:13Z","title":"Changes in Commuter Behavior from COVID-19 Lockdowns in the Atlanta\n  Metropolitan Area","summary":"  This paper analyzes the impact of COVID-19 related lockdowns in the Atlanta,\nGeorgia metropolitan area by examining commuter patterns in three periods:\nprior to, during, and after the pandemic lockdown.

Existing policy models usually\nimitate action combinations from the labeled multi-action dialog examples. Due\nto data limitations, they generalize poorly toward unseen dialog flows. While\nreinforcement learning-based methods are proposed to incorporate the service\nratings from real users and user simulators as external supervision signals,\nthey suffer from sparse and less credible dialog-level rewards. To cope with\nthis problem, we explore to improve multi-action dialog policy learning with\nexplicit and implicit turn-level user feedback received for historical\npredictions (i.e., logged user feedback) that are cost-efficient to collect and\nfaithful to real-world scenarios. The task is challenging since the logged user\nfeedback provides only partial label feedback limited to the particular\nhistorical dialog actions predicted by the agent.

Recent studies have demonstrated that CNN models\nexhibit a strong bias toward styles (i.e., textures) rather than content, in\nstark contrast to the human-vision system.

Nonetheless, these methods are either\nfounded on hand-picked model generations that are favored by human annotators,\nrendering them ineffective in terms of data utilization and challenging to\napply in general, or they depend on reward functions and reinforcement\nlearning, which are prone to imperfect reward function and extremely\nchallenging to optimize. In this work, we propose a novel technique, Chain of\nHindsight, that is easy to optimize and can learn from any form of feedback,\nregardless of its polarity.

This can\nresult in a biased model when deployed, leading to a reduction in model\nperformance. One risk is that, as the population changes, certain demographic\ngroups will be under-served or otherwise disadvantaged by the model, even as\nthey become more represented in the target population. The field of domain\nadaptation proposes techniques for a situation where label data for the target\npopulation does not exist, but some information about the target distribution\ndoes exist. In this paper we contribute to the domain adaptation literature by\nintroducing domain-adaptive decision trees (DADT). We focus on decision trees\ngiven their growing popularity due to their interpretability and performance\nrelative to other more complex models. With DADT we aim to improve the accuracy\nof models trained in a source domain (or training data) that differs from the\ntarget domain (or test data). We propose an in-processing step that adjusts the\ninformation gain split criterion with outside information corresponding to the\ndistribution of the target population.

To this end, we\npropose a Neighborhood Aggregation Graph Transformer (NAGphormer) that treats\neach node as a sequence containing a series of tokens constructed by our\nproposed Hop2Token module. For each node, Hop2Token aggregates the neighborhood\nfeatures from different hops into different representations and thereby\nproduces a sequence of token vectors as one input. In this way, NAGphormer\ncould be trained in a mini-batch manner and thus could scale to large graphs.\nMoreover, we mathematically show that as compared to a category of advanced\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs), the decoupled Graph Convolutional Network,\nNAGphormer could learn more informative node representations from the multi-hop\nneighborhoods.

In\nprinciple, if an agent can at least evaluate its own success (i.e., with a\nreward classifier that generalizes well even when the policy does not), it\ncould actively practice the task and finetune the policy in this situation. We\nstudy this problem in the setting of industrial insertion tasks, such as\ninserting connectors in sockets and setting screws. Existing algorithms rely on\nprecise localization of the connector or socket and carefully managed physical\nsetups, such as assembly lines, to succeed at the task. But in unstructured\nenvironments such as homes or even some industrial settings, robots cannot rely\non precise localization and may be tasked with previously unseen connectors.\nOffline reinforcement learning on a variety of connector insertion tasks is a\npotential solution, but what if the robot is tasked with inserting previously\nunseen connector? In such a scenario, we will still need methods that can\nrobustly solve such tasks with online practice. One of the main observations we\nmake in this work is that, with a suitable representation learning and domain\ngeneralization approach, it can be significantly easier for the reward function\nto generalize to a new but structurally similar task (e.g., inserting a new\ntype of connector) than for the policy. This means that a learned reward\nfunction can be used to facilitate the finetuning of the robot's policy in\nsituations where the policy fails to generalize in zero shot, but the reward\nfunction generalizes successfully. We show that such an approach can be\ninstantiated in the real world, pretrained on 50 different connectors, and\nsuccessfully finetuned to new connectors via the learned reward function.\nVideos can be viewed at https://sites.google.com/view/learningonthejob\n","authors":["Ashvin Nair","Brian Zhu","Gokul Narayanan","Eugen Solowjow","Sergey Levine"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15206v2.pdf","comment":"10 pages.

Virtual machines (VM) form the foundation of modern cloud\ncomputing as they help logically abstract user compute from shared physical\ninfrastructure. Traditionally, VM packing problems are solved by predicting\ndemand, followed by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization over a future\nhorizon. We introduce an approximate formulation of an industrial VM packing\nproblem as an MILP with soft-constraints parameterized by the predictions.\nRecently, predict-and-optimize (PnO) was proposed for end-to-end training of\nprediction models by back-propagating the cost of decisions through the\noptimization problem.

To tackle this issue, we propose the\nPredict-and-Critic (PnC) framework that outperforms PnO with just a two-step\nhorizon by leveraging reinforcement learning. PnC jointly trains a prediction\nmodel and a terminal Q function that approximates cost-to-go over a long\nhorizon, by back-propagating the cost of decisions through the optimization\nproblem \\emph{and from the future}.

Unfortunately, FL faces two critical challenges\nthat hinder its actual performance: data distribution heterogeneity and high\nresource costs brought by large foundation models. Specifically, the non-IID\ndata in different clients make existing FL algorithms hard to converge while\nthe high resource costs, including computational and communication costs that\nincrease the deployment difficulty in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we\npropose an effective yet simple method, named FedCLIP, to achieve fast\ngeneralization and personalization for CLIP in federated learning.

One\nof the main difficulties in analyzing population dynamics is that we can only\nobtain observation data with coarse time intervals from fixed-point\nobservations due to experimental costs or measurement constraints. Recently,\nmodeling population dynamics by using continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and\ndynamic optimal transport has been proposed to infer the sample trajectories\nfrom a fixed-point observed population. While the sample behavior in CNFs is\ndeterministic, the actual sample in biological systems moves in an essentially\nrandom yet directional manner. Moreover, when a sample moves from point A to\npoint B in dynamical systems, its trajectory typically follows the principle of\nleast action in which the corresponding action has the smallest possible value.\nTo satisfy these requirements of the sample trajectories, we formulate the\nLagrangian Schr\\\"odinger bridge (LSB) problem and propose to solve it\napproximately by modeling the advection-diffusion process with regularized\nneural SDE. We also develop a model architecture that enables faster\ncomputation of the loss function.

We show that a\nsystem that combines a real-time light ranker with sourcing strategies capable\nof capturing additional information provides validated gains. We present two\nstrategies. The first strategy uses a notion of similarity in the interaction\ngraph, while the second strategy caches previous scores from the ranking stage.\nThe graph based strategy achieves a 4.08% revenue gain and the rankscore based\nstrategy achieves a 1.38% gain. These two strategies have biases that\ncomplement both the light ranker and one another. Finally, we describe a set of\nmetrics that we believe are valuable as a means of understanding the complex\nproduct trade offs inherent in industrial candidate generation systems.\n","authors":["Vanessa Cai","Pradeep Prabakar","Manuel Serrano Rebuelta","Lucas Rosen","Federico Monti","Katarzyna Janocha","Tomo Lazovich","Jeetu Raj","Yedendra Shrinivasan","Hao Li","Thomas Markovich"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13915v1.pdf","comment":"9 pages, 3 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13756v1","updated":"2023-02-27T13:34:38Z","published":"2023-02-27T13:34:38Z","title":"Multi-Feature Integration for Perception-Dependent Examination-Bias\n  Estimation","summary":"  Eliminating examination bias accurately is pivotal to apply click-through\ndata to train an unbiased ranking model.

It has been proven to significantly benefit\nthe usage of KGs in many AI applications, such as question answering and\nrecommendation systems, etc. According to the graph types, the existing KGR\nmodels can be roughly divided into three categories, i.e., static models,\ntemporal models, and multi-modal models.

Besides the user-item interaction\ngraph, existing state-of-the-art methods usually use auxiliary graphs (e.g.,\nuser-user or item-item relation graph) to augment the learned representations\nof users and/or items. These representations are often propagated and\naggregated on auxiliary graphs using graph convolutional networks, which can be\nprohibitively expensive in computation and memory, especially for large graphs.\nMoreover, existing multi-modal recommendation methods usually leverage randomly\nsampled negative examples in Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss to guide\nthe learning of user/item representations, which increases the computational\ncost on large graphs and may also bring noisy supervision signals into the\ntraining process. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel\nself-supervised multi-modal recommendation model, dubbed BM3, which requires\nneither augmentations from auxiliary graphs nor negative samples. Specifically,\nBM3 first bootstraps latent contrastive views from the representations of users\nand items with a simple dropout augmentation. It then jointly optimizes three\nmulti-modal objectives to learn the representations of users and items by\nreconstructing the user-item interaction graph and aligning modality features\nunder both inter- and intra-modality perspectives. BM3 alleviates both the need\nfor contrasting with negative examples and the complex graph augmentation from\nan additional target network for contrastive view generation.

This task is classically performed through manual scoring provided\nby trained annotators, at a great time expense. While a consistent body of work\nsuggests that natural language processing (NLP) tools can support the automatic\nanalysis of dream reports, proposed methods lacked the ability to reason over a\nreport's full context and required extensive data pre-processing. Furthermore,\nin most cases, these methods were not validated against standard manual scoring\napproaches. In this work, we address these limitations by adopting large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to study and replicate the manual annotation of dream\nreports, using a mixture of off-the-shelf and bespoke approaches, with a focus\non references to reports' emotions. Our results show that the off-the-shelf\nmethod achieves a low performance probably in light of inherent linguistic\ndifferences between reports collected in different (groups of) individuals.

In this study, we demonstrate the significance of\ndomain selection by assessing a state-of-the-art Bangla automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) model on a novel multi-domain Bangladeshi Bangla ASR\nevaluation benchmark - BanSpeech, which contains 7.2 hours of speech and 9802\nutterances from 19 distinct domains.

Experimental evaluation reveals the ASR model on SUBAK.KO\nfaces difficulty recognizing speech from domains with mostly spontaneous speech\nand has a high number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.

In this\npaper, we provide an overview of the recent advances on long texts modeling\nbased on Transformer models. Firstly, we introduce the formal definition of\nlong text modeling. Then, as the core content, we discuss how to process long\ninput to satisfy the length limitation and design improved Transformer\narchitectures to effectively extend the maximum context length. Following this,\nwe discuss how to adapt Transformer models to capture the special\ncharacteristics of long texts.

In particular, we prove that commonly used\nself-supervised objectives based on reconstruction or contrastive samples can\nboth recover useful posterior information for general topic models.\nEmpirically, we show that the same objectives can perform on par with posterior\ninference using the correct model, while outperforming posterior inference\nusing misspecified models.\n","authors":["Zeping Luo","Shiyou Wu","Cindy Weng","Mo Zhou","Rong Ge"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03539v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted at ICLR 2023.

As\nstudent responses are presented with natural language, aligning the scoring\nprocedure as the next sentence prediction task using prompts can skip the\ncostly fine-tuning stage. In this study, we developed a zero-shot approach to\nautomatically score student responses via Matching Exemplars as Next Sentence\nPrediction (MeNSP). This approach employs no training samples. We first apply\nMeNSP in scoring three assessment tasks of scientific argumentation and found\nmachine-human scoring agreements, Cohen's Kappa ranges from 0.30 to 0.57, and\nF1 score ranges from 0.54 to 0.81.

Nevertheless, the cold-start recommendation remains a fundamental\nchallenge in which only a few user-item interactions are available for\npersonalization. Gradient-based meta-learning approaches have recently emerged\nin the sequential recommendation field due to their fast adaptation and\neasy-to-integrate abilities. The meta-learning algorithms formulate the\ncold-start recommendation as a few-shot learning problem, where each user is\nrepresented as a task to be adapted. However, while meta-learning algorithms\ngenerally assume that task-wise samples are evenly distributed over classes or\nvalues, user-item interactions are not that way in real-world applications\n(e.g., watching favorite videos multiple times, leaving only good ratings and\nno bad ones).

This work revisits the training framework and uncovers two major\nproblems hindering the expressiveness of learned multi-interest\nrepresentations. First, the current training objective (i.e., uniformly sampled\nsoftmax) fails to effectively train discriminative representations in a\nmulti-interest learning scenario due to the severe increase in easy negative\nsamples. Second, a routing collapse problem is observed where each learned\ninterest may collapse to express information only from a single item, resulting\nin information loss. To address these issues, we propose the REMI framework,\nconsisting of an Interest-aware Hard Negative mining strategy (IHN) and a\nRouting Regularization (RR) method. IHN emphasizes interest-aware hard\nnegatives by proposing an ideal sampling distribution and developing a\nMonte-Carlo strategy for efficient approximation. RR prevents routing collapse\nby introducing a novel regularization term on the item-to-interest routing\nmatrices. These two components enhance the learned multi-interest\nrepresentations from both the optimization objective and the composition\ninformation. REMI is a general framework that can be readily applied to various\nexisting multi-interest candidate matching methods.

For images represented in pixel space this is not the case, as\ndistances in pixel space are often not capturing our sense of similarity and\ntherefore neighbors are not semantically close. This problem can be\ncircumvented by self-supervised approaches based on contrastive learning, such\nas SimCLR, relying on data augmentation to generate implicit neighbors, but\nthese methods do not produce two-dimensional embeddings suitable for\nvisualization. Here, we present a new method, called t-SimCNE, for unsupervised\nvisualization of image data. T-SimCNE combines ideas from contrastive learning\nand neighbor embeddings, and trains a parametric mapping from the\nhigh-dimensional pixel space into two dimensions. We show that the resulting 2D\nembeddings achieve classification accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art\nhigh-dimensional SimCLR representations, thus faithfully capturing semantic\nrelationships.

One of the key\npoints of EFD is developing a generic model to extract robust and\ndiscriminative features from different equipment for early fault detection.\nMost existing EFD methods focus on learning fault representation by one type of\nfeature. However, a combination of multiple features can capture a more\ncomprehensive representation of system state. In this paper, we propose an EFD\nmethod based on multiple feature fusion with stacking architecture (M2FSA). The\nproposed method can extract generic and discriminiative features to detect\nearly faults by combining time domain (TD), frequency domain (FD), and\ntime-frequency domain (TFD) features. In order to unify the dimensions of the\ndifferent domain features, Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) is utilized to\nlearn deep features in three domains. The architecture of the proposed M2FSA\nconsists of two layers. The first layer contains three base models, whose\ncorresponding inputs are different deep features. The outputs of the first\nlayer are concatenated to generate the input to the second layer, which\nconsists of a meta model. The proposed method is tested on three bearing\ndatasets.

We evaluate (1) the ratio of their output modularity to\nthe maximum modularity for each input graph and (2) the maximum similarity\nbetween their output partition and any optimal partition of that graph.

Gradient-based meta-learning approaches have recently emerged\nin the sequential recommendation field due to their fast adaptation and\neasy-to-integrate abilities. The meta-learning algorithms formulate the\ncold-start recommendation as a few-shot learning problem, where each user is\nrepresented as a task to be adapted. However, while meta-learning algorithms\ngenerally assume that task-wise samples are evenly distributed over classes or\nvalues, user-item interactions are not that way in real-world applications\n(e.g., watching favorite videos multiple times, leaving only good ratings and\nno bad ones).

In DO, each agent iteratively solves a\nlocal optimization model constructed by its own data and communicates some\ninformation (e.g., a local solution) with its neighbors until a global solution\nis obtained. Even though locally stored data are not shared with other agents,\nit is still possible to reconstruct the data from the information communicated\namong agents, which could limit the practical usage of DO in applications with\nsensitive data. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving DO\nalgorithm for constrained convex optimization models, which provides a\nstatistical guarantee of data privacy, known as differential privacy, and a\nsequence of iterates that converges to an optimal solution in expectation. The\nproposed algorithm generalizes a linearized alternating direction method of\nmultipliers by introducing a multiple local updates technique to reduce\ncommunication costs and incorporating an objective perturbation method in the\nlocal optimization models to compute and communicate randomized feasible local\nsolutions that cannot be utilized to reconstruct the local data, thus\npreserving data privacy. Under the existence of convex constraints, we show\nthat, while both algorithms provide the same level of data privacy, the\nobjective perturbation used in the proposed algorithm can provide better\nsolutions than does the widely adopted output perturbation method that\nrandomizes the local solutions by adding some noise.

MDP is limited by\nthe Markovian assumption that a reward only depends on the immediate state and\naction. However, a reward sometimes depends on the history of states and\nactions, which may result in the decision process in a non-Markovian\nenvironment. In such environments, agents receive rewards via\ntemporally-extended behaviors sparsely, and the learned policies may be\nsimilar. This leads the agents acquired with similar policies generally overfit\nto the given task and can not quickly adapt to perturbations of environments.\nTo resolve this problem, this paper tries to learn the diverse policies from\nthe history of state-action pairs under a non-Markovian environment, in which a\npolicy dispersion scheme is designed for seeking diverse policy representation.\nSpecifically, we first adopt a transformer-based method to learn policy\nembeddings. Then, we stack the policy embeddings to construct a dispersion\nmatrix to induce a set of diverse policies. Finally, we prove that if the\ndispersion matrix is positive definite, the dispersed embeddings can\neffectively enlarge the disagreements across policies, yielding a diverse\nexpression for the original policy embedding distribution.

However, most existing methods do not exploit the\ninterest invariance between domains, which would yield sub-optimal solutions.\nIn this paper, we propose a cross-domain recommendation method: Self-supervised\nInterest Transfer Network (SITN), which can effectively transfer invariant\nknowledge between domains via prototypical contrastive learning. Specifically,\nwe perform two levels of cross-domain contrastive learning: 1)\ninstance-to-instance contrastive learning, 2) instance-to-cluster contrastive\nlearning. Not only that, we also take into account users' multi-granularity and\nmulti-view interests. With this paradigm, SITN can explicitly learn the\ninvariant knowledge of interest clusters between domains and accurately capture\nusers' intents and preferences. We conducted extensive experiments on a public\ndataset and a large-scale industrial dataset collected from one of the world's\nleading e-commerce corporations.

It is often\nreported that TS is fairly insensitive to the choice of the prior when it comes\nto regret bounds.

In this paper, we first extend the regret analysis of\nTS to the model of uniform distributions with unknown supports. Specifically,\nwe show that a switch of noninformative priors drastically affects the regret\nin expectation. Through our analysis, the uniform prior is proven to be the\noptimal choice in terms of the expected regret, while the reference prior and\nthe Jeffreys prior are found to be suboptimal, which is consistent with\nprevious findings in the model of Gaussian distributions. However, the uniform\nprior is specific to the parameterization of the distributions, meaning that if\nan agent considers different parameterizations of the same model, the agent\nwith the uniform prior might not always achieve the optimal performance. In\nlight of this limitation, we propose a slightly modified TS-based policy,\ncalled TS with Truncation (TS-T), which can achieve the asymptotic optimality\nfor the Gaussian distributions and the uniform distributions by using the\nreference prior and the Jeffreys prior that are invariant under one-to-one\nreparameterizations.

Federated learning (FL), as a revolutionary learning approach,\nenables collaborative AI model training across distributed mobile edge devices.\nBy exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels,\nover-the-air computation allows concurrent model uploading from massive devices\nover the same radio resources, and thus significantly reduces the communication\ncost of FL. In this paper, we study the coexistence of over-the-air FL and\ntraditional information transfer (IT) in a mobile edge network. We propose a\ncoexisting federated learning and information transfer (CFLIT) communication\nframework, where the FL and IT devices share the wireless spectrum in an OFDM\nsystem. Under this framework, we aim to maximize the IT data rate and guarantee\na given FL convergence performance by optimizing the long-term radio resource\nallocation. A key challenge that limits the spectrum efficiency of the\ncoexisting system lies in the large overhead incurred by frequent communication\nbetween the server and edge devices for FL model aggregation. To address the\nchallenge, we rigorously analyze the impact of the computation-to-communication\nratio on the convergence of over-the-air FL in wireless fading channels. The\nanalysis reveals the existence of an optimal computation-to-communication ratio\nthat minimizes the amount of radio resources needed for over-the-air FL to\nconverge to a given error tolerance. Based on the analysis, we propose a\nlow-complexity online algorithm to jointly optimize the radio resource\nallocation for both the FL devices and IT devices.

As one way to implement privacy-preserving AI,\ndifferentially private learning is a framework that enables AI models to use\ndifferential privacy (DP). To achieve DP in the learning process, existing\nalgorithms typically limit the magnitude of gradients with a constant clipping,\nwhich requires carefully tuned due to its significant impact on model\nperformance. As a solution to this issue, latest works NSGD and Auto-S\ninnovatively propose to use normalization instead of clipping to avoid\nhyperparameter tuning. However, normalization-based approaches like NSGD and\nAuto-S rely on a monotonic weight function, which imposes excessive weight on\nsmall gradient samples and introduces extra deviation to the update. In this\npaper, we propose a Differentially Private Per-Sample Adaptive Clipping\n(DP-PSAC) algorithm based on a non-monotonic adaptive weight function, which\nguarantees privacy without the typical hyperparameter tuning process of using a\nconstant clipping while significantly reducing the deviation between the update\nand true batch-averaged gradient.

One of the security threats\nfacing GCNs is the backdoor attack, which hides incorrect classification rules\nin models and activates only when the model encounters specific inputs\ncontaining special features (e.g., fixed patterns like subgraphs, called\ntriggers), thus outputting incorrect classification results, while the model\nbehaves normally on benign samples. The semantic backdoor attack is a type of\nthe backdoor attack where the trigger is a semantic part of the sample; i.e.,\nthe trigger exists naturally in the original dataset and the attacker can pick\na naturally occurring feature as the backdoor trigger, which causes the model\nto misclassify even unmodified inputs.

Although adversarial\ntraining (AT) is currently one of the most effective methodologies to robustify\nDNNs, it is computationally very expensive (e.g., 5-10X costlier than standard\ntraining). To address this challenge, existing approaches focus on single-step\nAT, referred to as Fast AT, reducing the overhead of adversarial example\ngeneration.

We find that, while the\nrepresentations LMs leverage in performing each task are highly entangled, they\nmay be meaningfully interpreted in terms of the tasks where they are most\nutilized; and more broadly, that CALM enables an expanded scope of inquiry in\nLM analysis that may be useful in predicting and explaining weaknesses of\nexisting LMs.\n","authors":["Adam Davies","Jize Jiang","ChengXiang Zhai"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00333v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12840v2","updated":"2023-03-01T08:43:13Z","published":"2023-02-24T18:17:38Z","title":"HULAT at SemEval-2023 Task 10: Data augmentation for pre-trained\n  transformers applied to the detection of sexism in social media","summary":"  This paper describes our participation in SemEval-2023 Task 10, whose goal is\nthe detection of sexism in social media.

If we view text generation as a sequential\ndecision-making problem, reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be a natural\nconceptual framework. However, using RL for LM-based generation faces empirical\nchallenges, including training instability due to the combinatorial action\nspace, as well as a lack of open-source libraries and benchmarks customized for\nLM alignment. Thus, a question rises in the research community: is RL a\npractical paradigm for NLP?\n  To help answer this, we first introduce an open-source modular library,\nRL4LMs (Reinforcement Learning for Language Models), for optimizing language\ngenerators with RL. The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be\nused to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library\n(Wolf et al. 2020) with an arbitrary reward function.

By performing a grid-search-based hyperparameter\noptimization on 23 feature spaces we can show that all considered classifiers\nare capable of outperforming the current state-of-the-art neural network-based\napproaches in terms of total IoU on their best-performing feature spaces. With\ntotal and mean IoU values of 0.8751 and 0.7031 compared to 0.70 and 0.5873 as\nthe previous best-reported results, we show that a simple gradient boosting\nclassifier can significantly improve over deep neural network based approaches,\ndespite using less training data. Furthermore, an analysis of the regional\ndistribution of the Sen1Floods11 dataset reveals a problem of spatial\nimbalance. We show that traditional machine learning models can learn this bias\nand argue that modified metric evaluations are required to counter artifacts\ndue to spatial imbalance. Lastly, a qualitative analysis shows that this\npixel-wise classifier provides highly-precise surface water classifications\nindicating that a good choice of a feature space and pixel-wise classification\ncan generate high-quality flood maps using optical and SAR data.

However, while some adoption of DP has\nhappened in industry, attempts to apply DP to real world complex ML models are\nstill few and far between. The adoption of DP is hindered by limited practical\nguidance of what DP protection entails, what privacy guarantees to aim for, and\nthe difficulty of achieving good privacy-utility-computation trade-offs for ML\nmodels. Tricks for tuning and maximizing performance are scattered among papers\nor stored in the heads of practitioners. Furthermore, the literature seems to\npresent conflicting evidence on how and whether to apply architectural\nadjustments and which components are ``safe'' to use with DP.\n  This work is a self-contained guide that gives an in-depth overview of the\nfield of DP ML and presents information about achieving the best possible DP ML\nmodel with rigorous privacy guarantees. Our target audience is both researchers\nand practitioners. Researchers interested in DP for ML will benefit from a\nclear overview of current advances and areas for improvement.

Varietal misidentification leads to\nmany potential problems for all the actors in the sector: farmers and nursery\nworkers may establish the wrong variety, leading to its maladaptation in the\nfield; olive oil and table olive producers may label and sell a non-authentic\nproduct; consumers may be misled; and breeders may commit errors during\ntargeted crossings between different varieties. To date, the standard for\nvarietal identification and certification consists of two methods:\nmorphological classification and genetic analysis. The morphological\nclassification consists of the visual pairwise comparison of different organs\nof the olive tree, where the most important organ is considered to be the\nendocarp.

UEs typically are generated via a bilevel\noptimization framework with a surrogate model to remove (minimize) errors from\nthe original samples, and then applied to protect the data against unknown\ntarget models. However, existing UE generation methods all rely on an ideal\nassumption called label-consistency, where the hackers and protectors are\nassumed to hold the same label for a given sample. In this work, we propose and\npromote a more practical label-agnostic setting, where the hackers may exploit\nthe protected data quite differently from the protectors. E.g., a m-class\nunlearnable dataset held by the protector may be exploited by the hacker as a\nn-class dataset. Existing UE generation methods are rendered ineffective in\nthis challenging setting. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel\ntechnique called Unlearnable Clusters (UCs) to generate label-agnostic\nunlearnable examples with cluster-wise perturbations.

Direct knowledge of a nuisance helps build models that\nare robust to such changes, but requires extra annotations beyond labels and\ncovariates. In this paper, we develop an alternative way to produce robust\nmodels by data augmentation. These data augmentations corrupt semantic\ninformation to produce models that identify and adjust for where nuisances\ndrive predictions. We study semantic corruptions in powering different\nspurious-correlation avoiding methods on multiple out-of distribution (OOD)\ntasks like classifying waterbirds, natural language inference (NLI), and\ndetecting cardiomegaly in chest X-rays.\n","authors":["Aahlad Puli","Nitish Joshi","He He","Rajesh Ranganath"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01302v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14499v2","updated":"2023-03-01T05:45:02Z","published":"2022-09-29T01:30:34Z","title":"NVRadarNet: Real-Time Radar Obstacle and Free Space Detection for\n  Autonomous Driving","summary":"  Detecting obstacles is crucial for safe and efficient autonomous driving.

By\nquantifying these two effects on random graphs sampled from the Contextual\nStochastic Block Model (CSBM), we show that oversmoothing happens once the\nmixing effect starts to dominate the denoising effect, and the number of layers\nrequired for this transition is $O(\\log N/\\log (\\log N))$ for sufficiently\ndense graphs with $N$ nodes. We also extend our analysis to study the effects\nof Personalized PageRank (PPR), or equivalently, the effects of initial\nresidual connections on oversmoothing.

The goal of the program is to shift the participants'\nconsumption behavior to mitigate two issues a) the reverse power flow at the\nprimary substation, that occurs when generation from solar panels in the local\ngrid exceeds consumption and b) the system wide peak demand, that typically\noccurs during hours of the late afternoon. For the clustering stage, three\npopular algorithms for electrical load clustering are employed -- namely\nk-means, k-medoids and a hierarchical clustering algorithm -- alongside two\ndifferent distance metrics -- namely euclidean and constrained Dynamic Time\nWarping (DTW). We evaluate the methods using different validation metrics\nincluding a novel metric -- namely peak performance score (PPS) -- that we\npropose in the context of this study. The best setup is employed to divide\ndaily prosumer load profiles into clusters and each cluster is analyzed in\nterms of load shape, mean entropy and distribution of load profiles from each\nload type. These characteristics are then used to distinguish the clusters that\nwould be most likely to aid with the DR schemes would fit each cluster.\nFinally, we conceptualize a DR system that combines forecasting, clustering and\na price-based demand projection engine to produce daily individualized DR\nrecommendations and pricing policies for prosumers participating in the\nprogram.

The inconsistency\nof these two goals limits the GSL methods to learn the potential optimal graph\nstructure. Moreover, the joint learning framework suffers from scalability\nissues in terms of time and space during the process of estimation and\noptimization of the adjacency matrix. To mitigate these issues, we propose a\ngraph structure refinement (GSR) framework with a pretrain-finetune pipeline.\nSpecifically, The pre-training phase aims to comprehensively estimate the\nunderlying graph structure by a multi-view contrastive learning framework with\nboth intra- and inter-view link prediction tasks.

The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be\nused to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library\n(Wolf et al. 2020) with an arbitrary reward function.

However, we observe that most existing ITM models suffer from\ngradients vanishing at the beginning of training, which makes these models\nprone to falling into local minima. Most ITM models adopt triplet loss with\nHard Negative mining (HN) as the optimization objective. We find that\noptimizing an ITM model using only the hard negative samples can easily lead to\ngradient vanishing. In this paper, we derive the condition under which the\ngradient vanishes during training.

To alleviate the gradient\nvanishing problem, we propose a Selectively Hard Negative Mining (SelHN)\nstrategy, which chooses whether to mine hard negative samples according to the\ngradient vanishing condition. SelHN can be plug-and-play applied to existing\nITM models to give them better training behavior.

Drawing\ninspiration from the modern operationalized versions of ToM implemented in\nRabinowitz et al. (2018) and Zhu et al.

To address the issue of scalability, we present a simple\nand intuitive approach called Selective Memorization (SeMem), which only\nmemorizes difficult samples that the model is likely to struggle with. We\ndemonstrate that SeMem improves the scalability of semiparametric LMs for\ncontinual learning over streaming data in two ways: (1) data-wise scalability:\nas the model becomes stronger through continual learning, it will encounter\nfewer difficult cases that need to be memorized, causing the growth of the\nnon-parametric memory to slow down over time rather than growing at a linear\nrate with the size of training data; (2) model-wise scalability: SeMem allows a\nlarger model to memorize fewer samples than its smaller counterpart because it\nis rarer for a larger model to encounter incomprehensible cases, resulting in a\nnon-parametric memory that does not scale linearly with model size.

For a\nbetter performance in continuous VLN, we design a multi-level instruction\nunderstanding procedure and propose a novel model, Multi-Level Attention\nNetwork (MLANet). The first step of MLANet is to generate sub-instructions\nefficiently. We design a Fast Sub-instruction Algorithm (FSA) to segment the\nraw instruction into sub-instructions and generate a new sub-instruction\ndataset named ``FSASub\". FSA is annotation-free and faster than the current\nmethod by 70 times, thus fitting the real-time requirement in continuous VLN.\nTo solve the complex instruction understanding problem, MLANet needs a global\nperception of the instruction and observations. We propose a Multi-Level\nAttention (MLA) module to fuse vision, low-level semantics, and high-level\nsemantics, which produce features containing a dynamic and global comprehension\nof the task. MLA also mitigates the adverse effects of noise words, thus\nensuring a robust understanding of the instruction. To correctly predict\nactions in long trajectories, MLANet needs to focus on what sub-instruction is\nbeing executed every step.

Prior work has\ntrained the dialog agents solely on VisDial data via supervised learning or\nleveraged pre-training on related vision-and-language datasets. This paper\npresents a semi-supervised learning approach for visually-grounded dialog,\ncalled Generative Self-Training (GST), to leverage unlabeled images on the Web.\nSpecifically, GST first retrieves in-domain images through out-of-distribution\ndetection and generates synthetic dialogs regarding the images via multimodal\nconditional text generation. GST then trains a dialog agent on the synthetic\nand the original VisDial data. As a result, GST scales the amount of training\ndata up to an order of magnitude that of VisDial (1.2M to 12.9M QA data). For\nrobust training of the synthetic dialogs, we also propose perplexity-based data\nselection and multimodal consistency regularization. Evaluation on VisDial v1.0\nand v0.9 datasets shows that GST achieves new state-of-the-art results on both\ndatasets. We further observe the robustness of GST against both visual and\ntextual adversarial attacks. Finally, GST yields strong performance gains in\nthe low-data regime.

Specifically, a sequence of\ndiscrete representations derived in a self-supervised manner are predicted from\nthe model and passed to a vocoder for speech reconstruction, while still facing\nthe following challenges: 1) Acoustic multimodality: the discrete units derived\nfrom speech with same content could be indeterministic due to the acoustic\nproperty (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and energy), which causes deterioration of\ntranslation accuracy; 2) high latency: current S2ST systems utilize\nautoregressive models which predict each unit conditioned on the sequence\npreviously generated, failing to take full advantage of parallelism. In this\nwork, we propose TranSpeech, a speech-to-speech translation model with\nbilateral perturbation. To alleviate the acoustic multimodal problem, we\npropose bilateral perturbation (BiP), which consists of the style normalization\nand information enhancement stages, to learn only the linguistic information\nfrom speech samples and generate more deterministic representations. With\nreduced multimodality, we step forward and become the first to establish a\nnon-autoregressive S2ST technique, which repeatedly masks and predicts unit\nchoices and produces high-accuracy results in just a few cycles. Experimental\nresults on three language pairs demonstrate that BiP yields an improvement of\n2.9 BLEU on average compared with a baseline textless S2ST model.

Compared with the cascade approach,\nwhich combines automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text summarization\nmodels, the E2E approach is more promising because it mitigates ASR errors,\nincorporates nonverbal information, and simplifies the overall system. However,\nsince collecting a large amount of paired data (i.e., speech and summary) is\ndifficult, the training data is usually insufficient to train a robust E2E SSum\nsystem. In this paper, we present two novel methods that leverage a large\namount of external text summarization data for E2E SSum training. The first\ntechnique is to utilize a text-to-speech (TTS) system to generate synthesized\nspeech, which is used for E2E SSum training with the text summary. The second\nis a TTS-free method that directly inputs phoneme sequence instead of\nsynthesized speech to the E2E SSum model. Experiments show that our proposed\nTTS- and phoneme-based methods improve several metrics on the How2 dataset. In\nparticular, our best system outperforms a previous state-of-the-art one by a\nlarge margin (i.e., METEOR score improvements of more than 6 points). To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first work to use external language\nresources for E2E SSum. Moreover, we report a detailed analysis of the How2\ndataset to confirm the validity of our proposed E2E SSum system.\n","authors":["Kohei Matsuura","Takanori Ashihara","Takafumi Moriya","Tomohiro Tanaka","Atsunori Ogawa","Marc Delcroix","Ryo Masumura"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00978v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted to ICASSP 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00969v1","updated":"2023-03-02T05:06:44Z","published":"2023-03-02T05:06:44Z","title":"Rethinking the Reasonability of the Test Set for Simultaneous Machine\n  Translation","summary":"  Simultaneous machine translation (SimulMT) models start translation before\nthe end of the source sentence, making the translation monotonically aligned\nwith the source sentence.

Prior work has shown\nthat pretrained LMs can be taught to caption images when a vision model's\nparameters are optimized to encode images in the language space. We test a\nstronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations learned by frozen\ntext-only models and vision-only models are similar enough that this can be\nachieved with a linear map. We show that the image representations from vision\nmodels can be transferred as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only\na single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive\nperformance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to\nmodels that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA\nmodel). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic\nsupervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),\nNF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language\ndescriptions). We find that all three encoders perform equally well at\ntransferring visual property information to the language model (e.g., whether\nan animal is large or small), but that image encoders pretrained with\nlinguistic supervision more saliently encode category information (e.g.,\ndistinguishing hippo vs. elephant) and thus perform significantly better on\nbenchmark language-and-vision tasks.

However, our\ntheoretical analysis reveals that DR usually has a large variance.

An aspirational goal is to\nconstruct self-improving robots: robots that can learn and improve on their\nown, from autonomous interaction with minimal human supervision or oversight.\nSuch robots could collect and train on much larger datasets, and thus learn\nmore robust and performant policies. While reinforcement learning offers a\nframework for such autonomous learning via trial-and-error, practical\nrealizations end up requiring extensive human supervision for reward function\ndesign and repeated resetting of the environment between episodes of\ninteractions.

However, data-driven hyperparameter tuning of ML methods\nrequires effective model evaluation to avoid large errors in causal estimates,\na task made more challenging because causal inference involves unavailable\ncounterfactuals. Multiple performance-validation metrics have recently been\nproposed such that practitioners now not only have to make complex decisions\nabout which causal estimators, ML learners and hyperparameters to choose, but\nalso about which evaluation metric to use. This paper, motivated by unclear\nrecommendations, investigates the interplay between the four different aspects\nof model evaluation for causal effect estimation.

In this paper, we\nstudy how the policy networks of typical DRL agents evolve during the learning\nprocess by empirically investigating several kinds of temporal change for each\npolicy parameter. On typical MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)\nbenchmarks, we find common phenomena for TD3 and RAD agents: 1) the activity of\npolicy network parameters is highly asymmetric and policy networks advance\nmonotonically along very few major parameter directions; 2) severe detours\noccur in parameter update and harmonic-like changes are observed for all minor\nparameter directions. By performing a novel temporal SVD along policy learning\npath, the major and minor parameter directions are identified as the columns of\nright unitary matrix associated with dominant and insignificant singular values\nrespectively. Driven by the discoveries above, we propose a simple and\neffective method, called Policy Path Trimming and Boosting (PPTB), as a general\nplug-in improvement to DRL algorithms.

In this\npaper, we investigate a novel framework of FEEL, namely semi-decentralized\nfederated edge learning (SD-FEEL), where multiple edge servers are employed to\ncollectively coordinate a large number of client nodes. By exploiting the\nlow-latency communication among edge servers for efficient model sharing,\nSD-FEEL can incorporate more training data, while enjoying much lower latency\ncompared with conventional federated learning.

Recently, data-driven approaches such as\n\\emph{random forest regression} have found their way into applications\n(Boulesteix et al., 2012). These models allow to directly derive measures of\nfeature importance, which are a natural indicator of the strength of the\ninfluence. For the relevant features, the correlation or rank correlation\nbetween the feature and the dependent variable has typically been used to\ndetermine the nature of the influence. More recent methods, some of which can\nalso measure interactions between features, are based on a modeling approach.\nIn particular, when machine learning models are used, SHAP scores are a recent\nand prominent method to determine these trends (Lundberg et al., 2017).\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel notion of feature importance based on the\nwell-studied Gram-Schmidt decorrelation method.

However, it is unknown if the models can handle more\ncomplex problems that involve math reasoning over heterogeneous information,\nsuch as tabular data. To fill the gap, we present Tabular Math Word Problems\n(TabMWP), a new dataset containing 38,431 open-domain grade-level problems that\nrequire mathematical reasoning on both textual and tabular data.

The over-parameterization\nmay result in undesirably large generalization error in the absence of other\ncustomized training strategies. Recently, a line of research under the name of\nSharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown that minimizing a sharpness\nmeasure, which reflects the geometry of the loss landscape, can significantly\nreduce the generalization error. However, SAM-like methods incur a two-fold\ncomputational overhead of the given base optimizer (e.g. SGD) for approximating\nthe sharpness measure. In this paper, we propose Sharpness-Aware Training for\nFree, or SAF, which mitigates the sharp landscape at almost zero additional\ncomputational cost over the base optimizer. Intuitively, SAF achieves this by\navoiding sudden drops in the loss in the sharp local minima throughout the\ntrajectory of the updates of the weights. Specifically, we suggest a novel\ntrajectory loss, based on the KL-divergence between the outputs of DNNs with\nthe current weights and past weights, as a replacement of the SAM's sharpness\nmeasure. This loss captures the rate of change of the training loss along the\nmodel's update trajectory. By minimizing it, SAF ensures the convergence to a\nflat minimum with improved generalization capabilities.

Prior work has shown\nthat pretrained LMs can be taught to caption images when a vision model's\nparameters are optimized to encode images in the language space. We test a\nstronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations learned by frozen\ntext-only models and vision-only models are similar enough that this can be\nachieved with a linear map. We show that the image representations from vision\nmodels can be transferred as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only\na single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive\nperformance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to\nmodels that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA\nmodel). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic\nsupervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),\nNF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language\ndescriptions).

For a\nbetter performance in continuous VLN, we design a multi-level instruction\nunderstanding procedure and propose a novel model, Multi-Level Attention\nNetwork (MLANet). The first step of MLANet is to generate sub-instructions\nefficiently. We design a Fast Sub-instruction Algorithm (FSA) to segment the\nraw instruction into sub-instructions and generate a new sub-instruction\ndataset named ``FSASub\". FSA is annotation-free and faster than the current\nmethod by 70 times, thus fitting the real-time requirement in continuous VLN.\nTo solve the complex instruction understanding problem, MLANet needs a global\nperception of the instruction and observations.

MLA also mitigates the adverse effects of noise words, thus\nensuring a robust understanding of the instruction.

We observed that while valence may rely heavily on lexical\nrepresentations, activation and dominance rely mostly on acoustic information.\nIn this work, we used multi-modal fusion representations from pre-trained\nmodels to generate state-of-the-art speech emotion estimation, and we showed a\n100% and 30% relative improvement in concordance correlation coefficient (CCC)\non valence estimation compared to standard acoustic and lexical baselines.\nFinally, we investigated the robustness of pre-trained model representations\nagainst noise and reverberation degradation and noticed that lexical and\nacoustic representations are impacted differently. We discovered that lexical\nrepresentations are more robust to distortions compared to acoustic\nrepresentations, and demonstrated that knowledge distillation from a\nmulti-modal model helps to improve the noise-robustness of acoustic-based\nmodels.\n","authors":["Vikramjit Mitra","Vasudha Kowtha","Hsiang-Yun Sherry Chien","Erdrin Azemi","Carlos Avendano"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03177v1.pdf","comment":"5 pages, conference"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03186v1","updated":"2023-03-03T16:11:37Z","published":"2023-03-03T16:11:37Z","title":"Will Affective Computing Emerge from Foundation Models and General AI?

Some\ncommunity detection methods are inferential, explicitly deriving the clustering\nobjective through a probabilistic generative model, while other methods are\ndescriptive, dividing a network according to an objective motivated by a\nparticular application, making it challenging to compare these methods on the\nsame scale. Here we present a solution to this problem that associates any\ncommunity detection objective, inferential or descriptive, with its\ncorresponding implicit network generative model.

The results motivate the need for objective task-based evaluation\nof DL-based denoising approaches. Further, this study shows how VCTs provide a\nmechanism to conduct such evaluations using VCTs. Finally, our theoretical\ntreatment reveals insights into the reasons for the limited performance of the\ndenoising approach.\n","authors":["Zitong Yu","Md Ashequr Rahman","Richard Laforest","Thomas H.

Thus, how to make full use of\nmulti-behavior information for recommendation is of great importance to the\nexisting system, which presents challenges in two aspects that need to be\nexplored: (1) Utilizing users' personalized preferences to capture\nmulti-behavioral dependencies; (2) Dealing with the insufficient recommendation\ncaused by sparse supervision signal for target behavior. In this work, we\npropose a Knowledge Enhancement Multi-Behavior Contrastive Learning\nRecommendation (KMCLR) framework, including two Contrastive Learning tasks and\nthree functional modules to tackle the above challenges, respectively. In\nparticular, we design the multi-behavior learning module to extract users'\npersonalized behavior information for user-embedding enhancement, and utilize\nknowledge graph in the knowledge enhancement module to derive more robust\nknowledge-aware representations for items. In addition, in the optimization\nstage, we model the coarse-grained commonalities and the fine-grained\ndifferences between multi-behavior of users to further improve the\nrecommendation effect.

However, the performance of\nexisting model-based approaches falls short of model-free counterparts, due to\nthe compounding of estimation errors in the learned model. Driven by this\nobservation, we argue that it is critical for a model-based method to\nunderstand when to trust the model and when to rely on model-free estimates,\nand how to act conservatively w.r.t. both. To this end, we derive an elegant\nand simple methodology called conservative Bayesian model-based value expansion\nfor offline policy optimization (CBOP), that trades off model-free and\nmodel-based estimates during the policy evaluation step according to their\nepistemic uncertainties, and facilitates conservatism by taking a lower bound\non the Bayesian posterior value estimate.

Our method, named RH-emo, is a novel semi-supervised architecture\naimed at extracting quaternion embeddings from real-valued monoaural\nspectrograms, enabling the use of quaternion-valued networks for speech emotion\nrecognition tasks. RH-emo is a hybrid real/quaternion autoencoder network that\nconsists of a real-valued encoder in parallel to a real-valued emotion\nclassifier and a quaternion-valued decoder. On the one hand, the classifier\npermits to optimize each latent axis of the embeddings for the classification\nof a specific emotion-related characteristic: valence, arousal, dominance and\noverall emotion.

Classical methods\nusually boil down to a backtracking framework that needs to navigate a huge\nsearch space with prohibitive computational costs. Some recent studies resort\nto graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a low-dimensional representation for\nboth the query and input graphs, in order to predict the number of subgraph\nisomorphisms on the input graph. However, typical GNNs employ a node-centric\nmessage passing scheme that receives and aggregates messages on nodes, which is\ninadequate in complex structure matching for isomorphism counting. Moreover, on\nan input graph, the space of possible query graphs is enormous, and different\nparts of the input graph will be triggered to match different queries. Thus,\nexpecting a fixed representation of the input graph to match diversely\nstructured query graphs is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN\ncalled Count-GNN for subgraph isomorphism counting, to deal with the above\nchallenges. At the edge level, given that an edge is an atomic unit of encoding\ngraph structures, we propose an edge-centric message passing scheme, where\nmessages on edges are propagated and aggregated based on the edge adjacency to\npreserve fine-grained structural information.

As\nhumans, we are competent at successfully adapting to those situations.\nSimilarly, an agent needs to have the ability to function under the impact of\nnovelties in order to properly operate in an open-world physical environment.\nTo facilitate the development of such AI systems, we propose a new testbed,\nNovPhy, that requires an agent to reason about physical scenarios in the\npresence of novelties and take actions accordingly. The testbed consists of\ntasks that require agents to detect and adapt to novelties in physical\nscenarios. To create tasks in the testbed, we develop eight novelties\nrepresenting a diverse novelty space and apply them to five commonly\nencountered scenarios in a physical environment. According to our testbed\ndesign, we evaluate two capabilities of an agent: the performance on a novelty\nwhen it is applied to different physical scenarios and the performance on a\nphysical scenario when different novelties are applied to it. We conduct a\nthorough evaluation with human players, learning agents, and heuristic agents.\nOur evaluation shows that humans' performance is far beyond the agents'\nperformance. Some agents, even with good normal task performance, perform\nsignificantly worse when there is a novelty, and the agents that can adapt to\nnovelties typically adapt slower than humans.

Even though numerous efforts have been devoted to\ndeveloping self-supervised models for time series data, we argue that the\ncurrent methods are not sufficient to learn optimal time series representations\ndue to solely unidirectional encoding over sparse point-wise input units. In\nthis work, we propose TimeMAE, a novel self-supervised paradigm for learning\ntransferrable time series representations based on transformer networks. The\ndistinct characteristics of the TimeMAE lie in processing each time series into\na sequence of non-overlapping sub-series via window-slicing partitioning,\nfollowed by random masking strategies over the semantic units of localized\nsub-series. Such a simple yet effective setting can help us achieve the goal of\nkilling three birds with one stone, i.e., (1) learning enriched contextual\nrepresentations of time series with a bidirectional encoding scheme; (2)\nincreasing the information density of basic semantic units; (3) efficiently\nencoding representations of time series using transformer networks.\nNevertheless, it is a non-trivial to perform reconstructing task over such a\nnovel formulated modeling paradigm. To solve the discrepancy issue incurred by\nnewly injected masked embeddings, we design a decoupled autoencoder\narchitecture, which learns the representations of visible (unmasked) positions\nand masked ones with two different encoder modules, respectively.

These rich video resources, on the one hand, benefited from the\npopularization of portable devices with cameras, but on the other, they can not\nbe independent of the valuable editing work contributed by numerous video\ncreators.

This technique helps to ease the\nlabor-intensive work during video editing, saving energy for creators so that\nthey can focus more on the creativity of video content. We formally define the\nABM problem and its evaluation protocol.

Deepfake often manipulates\nthe video content by tampering with some facial parts. However, this\nmanipulation usually breaks the consistency among facial parts, e.g., Deepfake\nmay change smiling lips to upset, but the eyes are still smiling. Existing\nworks propose to spot inconsistency on some specific facial parts (e.g., lips),\nbut they may perform poorly if new Deepfake techniques focus on the specific\nfacial parts used by the detector. Thus, this paper proposes a new Deepfake\ndetection model, DeepfakeMAE, which can utilize the consistencies among all\nfacial parts. Specifically, given a real face image, we first pretrain a masked\nautoencoder to learn facial part consistency by randomly masking some facial\nparts and reconstructing missing areas based on the remaining facial parts.\nFurthermore, to maximize the discrepancy between real and fake videos, we\npropose a novel model with dual networks that utilize the pretrained encoder\nand decoder, respectively. 1) The pretrained encoder is finetuned for capturing\nthe overall information of the given video. 2) The pretrained decoder is\nutilized for distinguishing real and fake videos based on the motivation that\nDeepfakeMAE's reconstruction should be more similar to a real face image than a\nfake one. Our extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that\nDeepfakeMAE is highly effective and especially outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 3.1% AUC on average in cross-dataset detection.\n","authors":["Juan Hu","Xin Liao","Difei Gao","Satoshi Tsutsui","Zheng Qin","Mike Zheng Shou"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01740v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01665v1","updated":"2023-03-03T02:00:49Z","published":"2023-03-03T02:00:49Z","title":"LooperGP: A Loopable Sequence Model for Live Coding Performance using\n  GuitarPro Tablature","summary":"  Despite their impressive offline results, deep learning models for symbolic\nmusic generation are not widely used in live performances due to a deficit of\nmusically meaningful control parameters and a lack of structured musical form\nin their outputs.

One problem of fusing audio and video information is\nthat they have different time resolutions.

Like \\cite{sepformer}, the LSTM in DPRNN\nis replaced by intra-chunk and inter-chunk self-attention, but in the proposed\nalgorithm, inter-chunk attention incorporates the visual features as an\nadditional feature stream.

Prior\nwork on universal sound separation has investigated separating a target sound\nout of an audio mixture given a text query. Such text-queried sound separation\nsystems provide a natural and scalable interface for specifying arbitrary\ntarget sounds. However, supervised text-queried sound separation systems\nrequire costly labeled audio-text pairs for training. Moreover, the audio\nprovided in existing datasets is often recorded in a controlled environment,\ncausing a considerable generalization gap to noisy audio in the wild. In this\nwork, we aim to approach text-queried universal sound separation by using only\nunlabeled data. We propose to leverage the visual modality as a bridge to learn\nthe desired audio-textual correspondence. The proposed CLIPSep model first\nencodes the input query into a query vector using the contrastive\nlanguage-image pretraining (CLIP) model, and the query vector is then used to\ncondition an audio separation model to separate out the target sound. While the\nmodel is trained on image-audio pairs extracted from unlabeled videos, at test\ntime we can instead query the model with text inputs in a zero-shot setting,\nthanks to the joint language-image embedding learned by the CLIP model.\nFurther, videos in the wild often contain off-screen sounds and background\nnoise that may hinder the model from learning the desired audio-textual\ncorrespondence. To address this problem, we further propose an approach called\nnoise invariant training for training a query-based sound separation model on\nnoisy data. Experimental results show that the proposed models successfully\nlearn text-queried universal sound separation using only noisy unlabeled\nvideos, even achieving competitive performance against a supervised model in\nsome settings.\n","authors":["Hao-Wen Dong","Naoya Takahashi","Yuki Mitsufuji","Julian McAuley","Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07065v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted by ICLR 2023.

However, in many practical recommendation\nscenarios (e.g., social media, e-commerce), there exist multi-typed interactive\nbehaviors in user-item relationships, such as click, tag-as-favorite, and\npurchase in online shopping platforms. Thus, how to make full use of\nmulti-behavior information for recommendation is of great importance to the\nexisting system, which presents challenges in two aspects that need to be\nexplored: (1) Utilizing users' personalized preferences to capture\nmulti-behavioral dependencies; (2) Dealing with the insufficient recommendation\ncaused by sparse supervision signal for target behavior.

While it has shown remarkable\nperformance even in unseen situations, it often performs in ways not intuitive\nto humans. Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the\ninput, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it\ncomes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\\&L pretrained\nmodels, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its\npronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding\nthat utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP\ntext encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based\nembedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation\nencoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative\nevaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space\nrepresents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed\nphoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm\nthat the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text\nencoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more\nphonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies\nthe correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception\nregarding pronunciation similarity.\n","authors":["Chihaya Matsuhira","Marc A.

This decoder is both data-efficient\nand computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the text data for training,\neasing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require\nend-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the\ntext embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix\nembedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but\nat the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs.\nThe modality gap issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models\nthat prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix\nembedding. We propose a training-free mechanism to reduce the modality gap. We\nproject the visual embedding into the CLIP text embedding space, while the\nprojected embedding retains the information of the visual input. Taking the\nprojected embedding as the prefix embedding, the decoder generates high-quality\ndescriptions that match the visual input.

Largely\northogonally, local model explanation methods have been developed that given a\nclassifier h and test point x, attribute influence for the prediction h(x) to\nthe individual features of x.

However,\nvoluminous amounts of data are necessary for deep models to perform\neffectively, which requires exhaustive and quality data collection,\nparticularly of state labels. Consequently, obtaining labelled state data for\nsoft robotic systems is challenged for various reasons, including difficulty in\nthe sensorization of soft robots and the inconvenience of collecting data in\nunstructured environments. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose\na semi-supervised sequential variational Bayes (DSVB) framework for transfer\nlearning and state inference in soft robots with missing state labels on\ncertain robot configurations. Considering that soft robots may exhibit distinct\ndynamics under different robot configurations, a feature space transfer\nstrategy is also incorporated to promote the adaptation of latent features\nacross multiple configurations. Unlike existing transfer learning approaches,\nour proposed DSVB employs a recurrent neural network to model the nonlinear\ndynamics and temporal coherence in soft robot data. The proposed framework is\nvalidated on multiple setup configurations of a pneumatic-based soft robot\nfinger.

The paradigm embodied by G-SSNNs offers a route towards\nthe communal development of compact and composable abstractions which can be\nflexibly repurposed for a variety of tasks and high-dimensional media. In\nfuture work, I hope to pursue these benefits by exploring more ambitious G-SSNN\ndesigns based on more complex classes of symbolic programs.

Existing approaches\ntypically assume a balanced class distribution for both labeled and unlabeled\nmedical images. However, medical image data in reality is commonly imbalanced\n(i.e., multi-class label imbalance), which naturally yields blurry contours and\nusually incorrectly labels rare objects. Moreover, it remains unclear whether\nall negative samples are equally negative. In this work, we present ACTION, an\nAnatomical-aware ConTrastive dIstillatiON framework, for semi-supervised\nmedical image segmentation. Specifically, we first develop an iterative\ncontrastive distillation algorithm by softly labeling the negatives rather than\nbinary supervision between positive and negative pairs. We also capture more\nsemantically similar features from the randomly chosen negative set compared to\nthe positives to enforce the diversity of the sampled data. Second, we raise a\nmore important question: Can we really handle imbalanced samples to yield\nbetter performance? Hence, the key innovation in ACTION is to learn global\nsemantic relationship across the entire dataset and local anatomical features\namong the neighbouring pixels with minimal additional memory footprint. During\nthe training, we introduce anatomical contrast by actively sampling a sparse\nset of hard negative pixels, which can generate smoother segmentation\nboundaries and more accurate predictions.

With the rise of machine learning,\nsurvival analysis can be modeled as learning a function that maps studied\npatients to their survival times. To succeed with that, there are three crucial\nissues to be tackled. First, some patient data is censored: we do not know the\ntrue survival times for all patients. Second, data is scarce, which led past\nresearch to treat different illness types as domains in a multi-task setup.\nThird, there is the need for adaptation to new or extremely rare illness types,\nwhere little or no labels are available. In contrast to previous multi-task\nsetups, we want to investigate how to efficiently adapt to a new survival\ntarget domain from multiple survival source domains. For this, we introduce a\nnew survival metric and the corresponding discrepancy measure between survival\ndistributions.

For optimization, which can be seen as a\nlow-temperature limit of sampling, it is known that smooth functions $V$ allow\nfaster convergence rates.

The goal is to increase and\nsometimes guarantee the robustness against adversarial attacks. Recent\npromising techniques draw inspirations from different backgrounds to design\n1-Lipschitz neural networks, just to name a few: convex potential layers derive\nfrom the discretization of continuous dynamical systems,\nAlmost-Orthogonal-Layer proposes a tailored method for matrix rescaling.\nHowever, it is today important to consider the recent and promising\ncontributions in the field under a common theoretical lens to better design new\nand improved layers. This paper introduces a novel algebraic perspective\nunifying various types of 1-Lipschitz neural networks, including the ones\npreviously mentioned, along with methods based on orthogonality and spectral\nmethods. Interestingly, we show that many existing techniques can be derived\nand generalized via finding analytical solutions of a common semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) condition.

However, comparing all records\nacross datasets can be computationally intensive, leading to long runtimes. To\nreduce these runtimes, entity resolution pipelines are constructed of two\nparts: a blocker that applies a computationally cheap method to select\ncandidate record pairs, and a matcher that afterwards identifies matching pairs\nfrom this set using more expensive methods. This paper presents SC-Block, a\nblocking method that utilizes supervised contrastive learning for positioning\nrecords in the embedding space, and nearest neighbour search for candidate set\nbuilding. We benchmark SC-Block against eight state-of-the-art blocking\nmethods. In order to relate the training time of SC-Block to the reduction of\nthe overall runtime of the entity resolution pipeline, we combine SC-Block with\nfour matching methods into complete pipelines. For measuring the overall\nruntime, we determine candidate sets with 98% pair completeness and pass them\nto the matcher. The results show that SC-Block is able to create smaller\ncandidate sets and pipelines with SC-Block execute 1.5 to 2 times faster\ncompared to pipelines with other blockers, without sacrificing F1 score.\nBlockers are often evaluated using relatively small datasets which might lead\nto runtime effects resulting from a large vocabulary size being overlooked.

Among different\nadversarial noises, universal adversarial perturbations (UAP), i.e., a constant\nimage-agnostic perturbation applied on every input frame of the agent, play a\ncritical role in Embodied Vision Navigation since they are\ncomputation-efficient and application-practical during the attack. However,\nexisting UAP methods ignore the system dynamics of Embodied Vision Navigation\nand might be sub-optimal. In order to extend UAP to the sequential decision\nsetting, we formulate the disturbed environment under the universal noise\n$\\delta$, as a $\\delta$-disturbed Markov Decision Process ($\\delta$-MDP). Based\non the formulation, we analyze the properties of $\\delta$-MDP and propose two\nnovel Consistent Attack methods, named Reward UAP and Trajectory UAP, for\nattacking Embodied agents, which consider the dynamic of the MDP and calculate\nuniversal noises by estimating the disturbed distribution and the disturbed Q\nfunction. For various victim models, our Consistent Attack can cause a\nsignificant drop in their performance in the PointGoal task in Habitat with\ndifferent datasets and different scenes.

One of the key challenges is that models\nlack supervision signals from unknown data, and as a result, can produce\noverconfident predictions on OOD data. Recent work on outlier synthesis modeled\nthe feature space as parametric Gaussian distribution, a strong and restrictive\nassumption that might not hold in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework, Non-Parametric Outlier Synthesis (NPOS), which generates artificial\nOOD training data and facilitates learning a reliable decision boundary between\nID and OOD data. Importantly, our proposed synthesis approach does not make any\ndistributional assumption on the ID embeddings, thereby offering strong\nflexibility and generality. We show that our synthesis approach can be\nmathematically interpreted as a rejection sampling framework. Extensive\nexperiments show that NPOS can achieve superior OOD detection performance,\noutperforming the competitive rivals by a significant margin.

However,\nreconstruction-based approaches are less favoured, as they require careful\ntuning of the model's information bottleneck - such as the size of the latent\ndimension - to produce good results. In this work, we exploit the view of\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) as denoising autoencoders where\nthe bottleneck is controlled externally, by means of the amount of noise\napplied. We propose to use DDPMs to reconstruct an input that has been noised\nto a range of noise levels, and use the resulting multi-dimensional\nreconstruction error to classify out-of-distribution inputs. We validate our\napproach both on standard computer-vision datasets and on higher dimension\nmedical datasets. Our approach outperforms not only reconstruction-based\nmethods, but also state-of-the-art generative-based approaches.\n","authors":["Mark S. Graham","Walter H. L.

The success of\nadversarial attacks raises serious concerns about the robustness of CNNs, and\nprevents them from being used in safety-critical applications, such as medical\ndiagnosis and autonomous driving. Our work introduces a visual analytics\napproach to understanding adversarial attacks by answering two questions: (1)\nwhich neurons are more vulnerable to attacks and (2) which image features do\nthese vulnerable neurons capture during the prediction? For the first question,\nwe introduce multiple perturbation-based measures to break down the attacking\nmagnitude into individual CNN neurons and rank the neurons by their\nvulnerability levels. For the second, we identify image features (e.g., cat\nears) that highly stimulate a user-selected neuron to augment and validate the\nneuron's responsibility. Furthermore, we support an interactive exploration of\na large number of neurons by aiding with hierarchical clustering based on the\nneurons' roles in the prediction.

In this paper, we propose a neighborhood contrastive\ntransformer to improve the model's perceiving ability for various changes under\ndifferent scenes and cognition ability for complex syntax structure.\nConcretely, we first design a neighboring feature aggregating to integrate\nneighboring context into each feature, which helps quickly locate the\ninconspicuous changes under the guidance of conspicuous referents. Then, we\ndevise a common feature distilling to compare two images at neighborhood level\nand extract common properties from each image, so as to learn effective\ncontrastive information between them.

While it has shown remarkable\nperformance even in unseen situations, it often performs in ways not intuitive\nto humans. Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the\ninput, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it\ncomes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\\&L pretrained\nmodels, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its\npronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding\nthat utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP\ntext encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based\nembedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation\nencoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative\nevaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space\nrepresents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed\nphoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm\nthat the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text\nencoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more\nphonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies\nthe correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception\nregarding pronunciation similarity.\n","authors":["Chihaya Matsuhira","Marc A.

However, effective utilization of LLMs\nfor zero-shot visual question-answering (VQA) remains challenging, primarily\ndue to the modality disconnection and task disconnection between LLM and VQA\ntask. End-to-end training on vision and language data may bridge the\ndisconnections, but is inflexible and computationally expensive. To address\nthis issue, we propose \\emph{Img2Prompt}, a plug-and-play module that provides\nthe prompts that can bridge the aforementioned modality and task\ndisconnections, so that LLMs can perform zero-shot VQA tasks without end-to-end\ntraining. In order to provide such prompts, we further employ LLM-agnostic\nmodels to provide prompts that can describe image content and self-constructed\nquestion-answer pairs, which can effectively guide LLM to perform zero-shot VQA\ntasks. Img2Prompt offers the following benefits: 1) It can flexibly work with\nvarious LLMs to perform VQA. 2)~Without the needing of end-to-end training, it\nsignificantly reduces the cost of deploying LLM for zero-shot VQA tasks. 3) It\nachieves comparable or better performance than methods relying on end-to-end\ntraining.

It often performs in a weakly supervised\nmanner, where only video event labels are provided, i.e., the modalities and\nthe timestamps of the labels are unknown. Due to the lack of densely annotated\nlabels, recent work attempts to leverage pseudo labels to enrich the\nsupervision. A commonly used strategy is to generate pseudo labels by\ncategorizing the known event labels for each modality. However, the labels are\nstill limited to the video level, and the temporal boundaries of event\ntimestamps remain unlabeled. In this paper, we propose a new pseudo label\ngeneration strategy that can explicitly assign labels to each video segment by\nutilizing prior knowledge learned from the open world. Specifically, we exploit\nthe CLIP model to estimate the events in each video segment based on visual\nmodality to generate segment-level pseudo labels. A new loss function is\nproposed to regularize these labels by taking into account their\ncategory-richness and segmentrichness. A label denoising strategy is adopted to\nimprove the pseudo labels by flipping them whenever high forward binary cross\nentropy loss occurs.

Traditionally, post-processing methods have\nbeen used to calibrate the model after training. In recent years, various\ntrainable calibration measures have been proposed to incorporate them directly\ninto the training process. However, these methods all incorporate internal\nhyperparameters, and the performance of these calibration objectives relies on\ntuning these hyperparameters, incurring more computational costs as the size of\nneural networks and datasets become larger. As such, we present Expected\nSquared Difference (ESD), a tuning-free (i.e., hyperparameter-free) trainable\ncalibration objective loss, where we view the calibration error from the\nperspective of the squared difference between the two expectations. With\nextensive experiments on several architectures (CNNs, Transformers) and\ndatasets, we demonstrate that (1) incorporating ESD into the training improves\nmodel calibration in various batch size settings without the need for internal\nhyperparameter tuning, (2) ESD yields the best-calibrated results compared with\nprevious approaches, and (3) ESD drastically improves the computational costs\nrequired for calibration during training due to the absence of internal\nhyperparameter.

However, previous work on federated recommender systems does not fully\nconsider the limitations of storage, RAM, energy and communication bandwidth in\na mobile environment. The scales of the models proposed are too large to be\neasily run on mobile devices.

We introduce a federated matrix\nfactorization (MF) framework, named meta matrix factorization (MetaMF). Given a\nuser, we first obtain a collaborative vector by collecting useful information\nwith a collaborative memory module. Then, we employ a meta recommender module\nto generate private item embeddings and a RP model based on the collaborative\nvector in the server. To address the challenge of generating a large number of\nhigh-dimensional item embeddings, we devise a rise-dimensional generation\nstrategy that first generates a low-dimensional item embedding matrix and a\nrise-dimensional matrix, and then multiply them to obtain high-dimensional\nembeddings. We use the generated model to produce private RPs for the given\nuser on her device.

A Preliminary Study","summary":"  Recently, the emergence of ChatGPT has attracted wide attention from the\ncomputational linguistics community. Many prior studies have shown that ChatGPT\nachieves remarkable performance on various NLP tasks in terms of automatic\nevaluation metrics. However, the ability of ChatGPT to serve as an evaluation\nmetric is still underexplored. Considering assessing the quality of NLG models\nis an arduous task and previous statistical metrics notoriously show their poor\ncorrelation with human judgments, we wonder whether ChatGPT is a good NLG\nevaluation metric. In this report, we provide a preliminary meta-evaluation on\nChatGPT to show its reliability as an NLG metric. In detail, we regard ChatGPT\nas a human evaluator and give task-specific (e.g., summarization) and\naspect-specific (e.g., relevance) instruction to prompt ChatGPT to score the\ngeneration of NLG models. We conduct experiments on three widely-used NLG\nmeta-evaluation datasets (including summarization, story generation and\ndata-to-text tasks). Experimental results show that compared with previous\nautomatic metrics, ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art or competitive correlation\nwith golden human judgments.

First, experiments\non ICL with flipped labels show that overriding semantic priors is an emergent\nability of model scale.

Though these\ngeneration capabilities hold great potential for breakthrough applications, it\ncan also be a tool for an adversary to generate misinformation. In particular,\nsocial media platforms like Twitter are highly susceptible to AI-generated\nmisinformation. A potential threat scenario is when an adversary hijacks a\ncredible user account and incorporates a natural language generator to generate\nmisinformation. Such threats necessitate automated detectors for AI-generated\ntweets in a given user's Twitter timeline.

Second, we raise a\nmore important question: Can we really handle imbalanced samples to yield\nbetter performance? Hence, the key innovation in ACTION is to learn global\nsemantic relationship across the entire dataset and local anatomical features\namong the neighbouring pixels with minimal additional memory footprint. During\nthe training, we introduce anatomical contrast by actively sampling a sparse\nset of hard negative pixels, which can generate smoother segmentation\nboundaries and more accurate predictions.

These are fully equivariant and body-ordered kernels that\ncan be computed iteratively with a cost that is independent of the\nradial-chemical basis and grows only linearly with the maximum body-order\nconsidered. This is in marked contrast to feature-space models, which comprise\nan exponentially-growing number of terms with increasing order of correlations.\nWe present several examples of the accuracy of models based on Wigner kernels\nin chemical applications, for both scalar and tensorial targets, reaching\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on the popular QM9 benchmark dataset, and we discuss\nthe broader relevance of these ideas to equivariant geometric machine-learning.\n","authors":["Filippo Bigi","Sergey N.

A natural question to ask is: How much more sample efficiency can\nbe gained by improving the learned dynamics models? Our paper empirically\nanswers this question for the class of model-based value expansion methods in\ncontinuous control problems. Value expansion methods should benefit from\nincreased model accuracy by enabling longer rollout horizons and better value\nfunction approximations. Our empirical study, which leverages oracle dynamics\nmodels to avoid compounding model errors, shows that (1) longer horizons\nincrease sample efficiency, but the gain in improvement decreases with each\nadditional expansion step, and (2) the increased model accuracy only marginally\nincreases the sample efficiency compared to learned models with identical\nhorizons. Therefore, longer horizons and increased model accuracy yield\ndiminishing returns in terms of sample efficiency. These improvements in sample\nefficiency are particularly disappointing when compared to model-free value\nexpansion methods. Even though they introduce no computational overhead, we\nfind their performance to be on-par with model-based value expansion methods.\nTherefore, we conclude that the limitation of model-based value expansion\nmethods is not the model accuracy of the learned models.

Although only the model parameters or\nother model updates are exchanged during the federated training instead of the\nparticipant's data, many attacks have shown that it is still possible to infer\nsensitive information such as membership, property, or outright reconstruction\nof participant data. Although differential privacy is considered an effective\nsolution to protect against privacy attacks, it is also criticized for its\nnegative effect on utility. Another possible defense is to use secure\naggregation which allows the server to only access the aggregated update\ninstead of each individual one, and it is often more appealing because it does\nnot degrade model quality. However, combining only the aggregated updates,\nwhich are generated by a different composition of clients in every round, may\nstill allow the inference of some client-specific information.\n  In this paper, we show that simple linear models can effectively capture\nclient-specific properties only from the aggregated model updates due to the\nlinearity of aggregation.

In fact, many meta-learning problems can\nbe treated as set-input tasks. Most existing summary networks aim to design\ndifferent architectures for the input set in order to enforce permutation\ninvariance. However, scant attention has been paid to the common cases where\ndifferent sets in a meta-distribution are closely related and share certain\nstatistical properties. Viewing each set as a distribution over a set of global\nprototypes, this paper provides a novel prototype-oriented optimal transport\n(POT) framework to improve existing summary networks. To learn the distribution\nover the global prototypes, we minimize its regularized optimal transport\ndistance to the set empirical distribution over data points, providing a\nnatural unsupervised way to improve the summary network.

How\nto learn a unitary transformation efficiently is a fundamental problem in\nquantum machine learning. The most natural and leading strategy is to train a\nquantum machine learning model based on a quantum dataset. Although the\npresence of more training data results in better models, using too much data\nreduces the efficiency of training. In this work, we solve the problem on the\nminimum size of sufficient quantum datasets for learning a unitary\ntransformation exactly, which reveals the power and limitation of quantum data.\nFirst, we prove that the minimum size of a dataset with pure states is $2^n$\nfor learning an $n$-qubit unitary transformation. To fully explore the\ncapability of quantum data, we introduce a practical quantum dataset consisting\nof $n+1$ elementary tensor product states that are sufficient for exact\ntraining. The main idea is to simplify the structure utilizing decoupling,\nwhich leads to an exponential improvement in the size of the datasets with pure\nstates. Furthermore, we show that the size of the quantum dataset with mixed\nstates can be reduced to a constant, which yields an optimal quantum dataset\nfor learning a unitary. We showcase the applications of our results in oracle\ncompiling and Hamiltonian simulation.

Existing studies have\nconsidered exclusively noise with persistent root-mean-square amplitude and\noverlooked an opportunity of adjusting the amplitudes to alleviate the adverse\neffects of the noise. This paper presents a new DP perturbation mechanism with\na time-varying noise amplitude to protect the privacy of FL and retain the\ncapability of adjusting the learning performance. Specifically, we propose a\ngeometric series form for the noise amplitude and reveal analytically the\ndependence of the series on the number of global aggregations and the\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP requirement.

Another important aspect is an upper bound developed for\nthe loss function of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained by FL running the\nnew DP mechanism. Accordingly, the optimal number of global aggregations is\nobtained, balancing the learning and privacy.

More specifically, for the output features of the\npenultimate layer, for each class the within-class features converge to their\nmeans, and the means of different classes exhibit a certain tight frame\nstructure, which is also aligned with the last layer's classifier. As feature\nnormalization in the last layer becomes a common practice in modern\nrepresentation learning, in this work we theoretically justify the neural\ncollapse phenomenon for normalized features. Based on an unconstrained feature\nmodel, we simplify the empirical loss function in a multi-class classification\ntask into a nonconvex optimization problem over the Riemannian manifold by\nconstraining all features and classifiers over the sphere. In this context, we\nanalyze the nonconvex landscape of the Riemannian optimization problem over the\nproduct of spheres, showing a benign global landscape in the sense that the\nonly global minimizers are the neural collapse solutions while all other\ncritical points are strict saddles with negative curvature. Experimental\nresults on practical deep networks corroborate our theory and demonstrate that\nbetter representations can be learned faster via feature normalization.\n","authors":["Can Yaras","Peng Wang","Zhihui Zhu","Laura Balzano","Qing Qu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09211v2.pdf","comment":"The first two authors contributed to this work equally; 38 pages, 13\n  figures.

We next study semantically-unrelated label\nICL (SUL-ICL), in which labels are semantically unrelated to their inputs\n(e.g., foo/bar instead of negative/positive), thereby forcing language models\nto learn the input-label mappings shown in in-context exemplars in order to\nperform the task. The ability to do SUL-ICL also emerges primarily with scale,\nand large-enough language models can even perform linear classification in a\nSUL-ICL setting. Finally, we evaluate instruction-tuned models and find that\ninstruction tuning strengthens both the use of semantic priors and the capacity\nto learn input-label mappings, but more of the former.\n","authors":["Jerry Wei","Jason Wei","Yi Tay","Dustin Tran","Albert Webson","Yifeng Lu","Xinyun Chen","Hanxiao Liu","Da Huang","Denny Zhou","Tengyu Ma"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03846v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03715v2","updated":"2023-03-08T02:02:20Z","published":"2023-03-07T07:56:38Z","title":"Universal resources for quantum computing","summary":"  Unravelling the source of quantum computing power has been a major goal in\nthe field of quantum information science. In recent years, the quantum resource\ntheory (QRT) has been established to characterize various quantum resources,\nyet their roles in quantum computing tasks still require investigation. The\nso-called universal quantum computing model (UQCM), e.g., the circuit model,\nhas been the main framework to guide the design of quantum algorithms, creation\nof real quantum computers etc. In this work, we combine the study of UQCM\ntogether with QRT. We find on one hand, using QRT can provide a\nresource-theoretic characterization of a UQCM, the relation among models and\ninspire new ones, and on the other hand, using UQCM offers a framework to apply\nresources, study relation among resources and classify them.\n  We develop the theory of universal resources in the setting of UQCM, and find\na rich spectrum of UQCMs and the corresponding universal resources. Depending\non a hierarchical structure of resource theories, we find models can be\nclassified into families. In this work, we study three natural families of\nUQCMs in details: the amplitude family, the quasi-probability family, and the\nHamiltonian family. They include some well known models, like the\nmeasurement-based model and adiabatic model, and also inspire new models such\nas the contextual model we introduce. Each family contains at least a triplet\nof models, and such a succinct structure of families of UQCMs offers a unifying\npicture to investigate resources and design models. It also provides a rigorous\nframework to resolve puzzles, such as the role of entanglement vs.\ninterference, and unravel resource-theoretic features of quantum algorithms.\n","authors":["D. -S.

For example, we might\naim to find a non-toxic input that starts with \"Barack Obama\" that a model maps\nto a toxic output.

To combat these challenges, we\nintroduce a discrete optimization algorithm, ARCA, that jointly and efficiently\noptimizes over inputs and outputs.

When the\nembedding model is updated, it might produce features that are not\ncomparable/compatible with features already in the gallery computed with the\nold model. Subsequently, all features in the gallery need to be re-computed\nusing the new embedding model -- a computationally expensive process called\nbackfilling. Recently, compatible representation learning methods have been\nproposed to avoid backfilling. Despite their relative success, there is an\ninherent trade-off between the new model performance and its compatibility with\nthe old model. In this work, we introduce FastFill: a compatible model update\nprocess using feature alignment and policy based partial backfilling to\npromptly elevate retrieval performance.

We find that when\npaired with LLMs to break down abstract natural language instructions into\nsubgoals via few-shot prompting, our method is capable of completing\nlong-horizon, multi-tier tasks in the real world, while requiring an order of\nmagnitude less data than previous approaches.

VLMaps\ncan be autonomously built from video feed on robots using standard exploration\napproaches and enables natural language indexing of the map without additional\nlabeled data. Specifically, when combined with large language models (LLMs),\nVLMaps can be used to (i) translate natural language commands into a sequence\nof open-vocabulary navigation goals (which, beyond prior work, can be spatial\nby construction, e.g., \"in between the sofa and TV\" or \"three meters to the\nright of the chair\") directly localized in the map, and (ii) can be shared\namong multiple robots with different embodiments to generate new obstacle maps\non-the-fly (by using a list of obstacle categories).

Various techniques have been proposed to improve performance in\ngoal-conditioned environments, such as automatic curriculum generation and goal\nrelabeling. In this work, we explore a connection between off-policy\nreinforcement learning in goal-conditioned settings and knowledge distillation.\nIn particular: the current Q-value function and the target Q-value estimate are\nboth functions of the goal, and we would like to train the Q-value function to\nmatch its target for all goals. We therefore apply Gradient-Based Attention\nTransfer (Zagoruyko and Komodakis 2017), a knowledge distillation technique, to\nthe Q-function update. We empirically show that this can improve the\nperformance of goal-conditioned off-policy reinforcement learning when the\nspace of goals is high-dimensional.

Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by\ndevelopers for its ``event-triggered\" mechanism for building education\nintelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to\nthe immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified,\nso problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the\neducational blockchain.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network\n(GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational\nblockchains.

In this paper, we show that if\nwe cast a contrastive objective equivalently into the feature space, then its\nlearning dynamics admits an interpretable form. Specifically, we show that its\ngradient descent corresponds to a specific message passing scheme on the\ncorresponding augmentation graph. Based on this perspective, we theoretically\ncharacterize how contrastive learning gradually learns discriminative features\nwith the alignment update and the uniformity update.

In either case, the network is optimized\nby minimizing mean square error (MSE) between ground-truth labels and\ntime-domain or spectrum output. However, existing schemes have either of two\ncritical issues: spectrum and metric mismatches. The spectrum mismatch is a\nwell known issue that any spectrum modification after short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT), in general, cannot be fully recovered after inverse\nshort-time Fourier transform (ISTFT). The metric mismatch is that a\nconventional MSE metric is sub-optimal to maximize our target metrics,\nsignal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality\n(PESQ). This paper presents a new end-to-end denoising framework with the goal\nof joint SDR and PESQ optimization.

In object-oriented environments, predicates are a particularly useful\nform of state abstraction because of their compatibility with symbolic planners\nand their capacity for relational generalization. However, to plan with\npredicates, the agent must be able to interpret them in continuous environment\nstates (i.e., ground the symbols). Manually programming predicate\ninterpretations can be difficult, so we would instead like to learn them from\ndata. We propose an embodied active learning paradigm where the agent learns\npredicate interpretations through online interaction with an expert. For\nexample, after taking actions in a block stacking environment, the agent may\nask the expert: \"Is On(block1, block2) true?\" From this experience, the agent\nlearns to plan: it learns neural predicate interpretations, symbolic planning\noperators, and neural samplers that can be used for bilevel planning. During\nexploration, the agent plans to learn: it uses its current models to select\nactions towards generating informative expert queries. We learn predicate\ninterpretations as ensembles of neural networks and use their entropy to\nmeasure the informativeness of potential queries. We evaluate this approach in\nthree robotic environments and find that it consistently outperforms six\nbaselines while exhibiting sample efficiency in two key metrics: number of\nenvironment interactions, and number of queries to the expert.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the impact of\ndifferent choices of linear and nonlinear architectures on the implicit bias of\nthe learned features and the adversarial perturbations, in both spatial and\nfrequency domains. We find that the high-frequency adversarial perturbations\nare critically dependent on the convolution operation because the\nspatially-limited nature of local convolutions induces an implicit bias towards\nhigh frequency features.

We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic\nsupervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),\nNF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language\ndescriptions). We find that all three encoders perform equally well at\ntransferring visual property information to the language model (e.g., whether\nan animal is large or small), but that image encoders pretrained with\nlinguistic supervision more saliently encode category information (e.g.,\ndistinguishing hippo vs. elephant) and thus perform significantly better on\nbenchmark language-and-vision tasks. Our results indicate that LMs encode\nconceptual information structurally similarly to vision-based models, even\nthose that are solely trained on images.

In this work, we address\nthis gap by learning models that predict the legibility of a perturbed string,\nand rank candidate perturbations based on their legibility. To do so, we\ncollect and release \\dataset, a human-annotated dataset comprising the\nlegibility of visually perturbed text. Using this dataset, we build both text-\nand vision-based models which achieve up to $0.91$ F1 score in predicting\nwhether an input is legible, and an accuracy of $0.86$ in predicting which of\ntwo given perturbations is more legible. Additionally, we discover that legible\nperturbations from the \\dataset dataset are more effective at lowering the\nperformance of NLP models than best-known attack strategies, suggesting that\ncurrent models may be vulnerable to a broad range of perturbations beyond what\nis captured by existing visual attacks.

Acute brain\ndysfunction status, delirium, is often underdiagnosed or undervalued. This\nstudy's objective was to develop automated computable phenotypes for acute\nbrain dysfunction states and describe transitions among brain dysfunction\nstates to illustrate the clinical trajectories of ICU patients. We created two\nsingle-center, longitudinal EHR datasets for 48,817 adult patients admitted to\nan ICU at UFH Gainesville (GNV) and Jacksonville (JAX).

There were 49,770 admissions for 37,835 patients\nin UFH GNV dataset and 18,472 admissions for 10,982 patients in UFH JAX\ndataset. In total, 18% of patients had coma as the worst brain dysfunction\nstatus; every 12 hours, around 4%-7% would transit to delirium, 22%-25% would\nrecover, 3%-4% would expire, and 67%-68% would remain in a coma in the ICU.\nAdditionally, 7% of patients had delirium as the worst brain dysfunction\nstatus; around 6%-7% would transit to coma, 40%-42% would be no delirium, 1%\nwould expire, and 51%-52% would remain delirium in the ICU.

To create this dataset, we employ a\ntext-to-image model to generate photo-realistic images, and an image captioning\nmodel to filter out unsuitable ones. The resulting dataset is of high quality,\ncontaining approximately 152,000 images. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat state-of-the-art group robustness methods struggle with Spawrious, most\nnotably on the Hard-splits with $<60\\%$ accuracy. By examining model\nmisclassifications, we detect reliances on spurious backgrounds, demonstrating\nthat our dataset provides a significant challenge to drive future research.\n","authors":["Aengus Lynch","Gbètondji J-S Dovonon","Jean Kaddour","Ricardo Silva"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05470v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05464v1","updated":"2023-03-09T18:10:45Z","published":"2023-03-09T18:10:45Z","title":"Resolving quantitative MRI model degeneracy with machine learning via\n  training data distribution design","summary":"  Quantitative MRI (qMRI) aims to map tissue properties non-invasively via\nmodels that relate these unknown quantities to measured MRI signals. Estimating\nthese unknowns, which has traditionally required model fitting - an often\niterative procedure, can now be done with one-shot machine learning (ML)\napproaches. Such parameter estimation may be complicated by intrinsic qMRI\nsignal model degeneracy: different combinations of tissue properties produce\nthe same signal. Despite their many advantages, it remains unclear whether ML\napproaches can resolve this issue. Growing empirical evidence appears to\nsuggest ML approaches remain susceptible to model degeneracy. Here we\ndemonstrate under the right circumstances ML can address this issue. Inspired\nby recent works on the impact of training data distributions on ML-based\nparameter estimation, we propose to resolve model degeneracy by designing\ntraining data distributions.

If a test set has a drastically different difficulty level from the\ncalibration set, the optimal calibration parameters of the two datasets would\nbe different.

It is difficult for operators to obtain accurate\nday-ahead forecasts of renewable generation, thereby requiring the future\nscheduling system to make real-time scheduling decisions aligning with\nultra-short-term forecasts. Restricted by the computation speed, traditional\noptimization-based methods can not solve this problem. Recent developments in\nreinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the potential to solve this\nchallenge.

In\norder to gain understanding of this implicit bias phenomenon we study the\nspecial case of sparse recovery (compressed sensing) which is of interest on\nits own. More precisely, in order to reconstruct a vector from underdetermined\nlinear measurements, we introduce a corresponding overparameterized square loss\nfunctional, where the vector to be reconstructed is deeply factorized into\nseveral vectors. We show that, if there exists an exact solution, vanilla\ngradient flow for the overparameterized loss functional converges to a good\napproximation of the solution of minimal $\\ell_1$-norm. The latter is\nwell-known to promote sparse solutions. As a by-product, our results\nsignificantly improve the sample complexity for compressed sensing via gradient\nflow/descent on overparameterized models derived in previous works.

In many\ncases the rough location may be known and a UAV can be deployed to explore a\ngiven, confined area to precisely localize the missing people. Due to time and\nbattery constraints it is often critical that localization is performed as\nefficiently as possible. In this work we approach this type of problem by\nabstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task in a framework that\nemulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to actual UAVs. In this\nframework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image (proxy for a search\narea) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is described in terms of visual\ncues. To further mimic the situation on an actual UAV, the agent is not able to\nobserve the search area in its entirety, not even at low resolution, and thus\nit has to operate solely based on partial glimpses when navigating towards the\ngoal. To tackle this task, we propose AiRLoc, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based model that decouples exploration (searching for distant goals) and\nexploitation (localizing nearby goals).

To address above\nchallenges, we systematically summarize the distribution shift in TSF into two\ncategories. Regarding lookback windows as input-space and horizon windows as\noutput-space, there exist (i) intra-space shift, that the distribution within\nthe input-space keeps shifted over time, and (ii) inter-space shift, that the\ndistribution is shifted between input-space and output-space. Then we\nintroduce, Dish-TS, a general neural paradigm for alleviating distribution\nshift in TSF. Specifically, for better distribution estimation, we propose the\ncoefficient net (CONET), which can be any neural architectures, to map input\nsequences into learnable distribution coefficients. To relieve intra-space and\ninter-space shift, we organize Dish-TS as a Dual-CONET framework to separately\nlearn the distribution of input- and output-space, which naturally captures the\ndistribution difference of two spaces. In addition, we introduce a more\neffective training strategy for intractable CONET learning.

But\ndespite showing pedagogical efficiency, this method is still limited as it\nrelies on generating the said cues by hand, which can be a very costly process.\nIn this context, we propose to leverage advances in the natural language\nprocessing field (NLP) and investigate the efficiency of using a large language\nmodel (LLM) for automating the production of the pedagogical content of a\ncurious question-asking (QA) training. We study generating the said content\nusing the \"prompt-based\" method that consists of explaining the task to the LLM\nin natural text.

Although preserving legibility is a necessary\ncondition for text perturbation, little work has been done to systematically\ncharacterize it; instead, legibility is typically loosely enforced via\nintuitions around the nature and extent of perturbations. Particularly, it is\nunclear to what extent can inputs be perturbed while preserving legibility, or\nhow to quantify the legibility of a perturbed string. In this work, we address\nthis gap by learning models that predict the legibility of a perturbed string,\nand rank candidate perturbations based on their legibility. To do so, we\ncollect and release LEGIT, a human-annotated dataset comprising the legibility\nof visually perturbed text.

Additionally, we discover that legible\nperturbations from the LEGIT dataset are more effective at lowering the\nperformance of NLP models than best-known attack strategies, suggesting that\ncurrent models may be vulnerable to a broad range of perturbations beyond what\nis captured by existing visual attacks.

So far, existing methods\nfor uncovering such artifactual behavior in trained models focus on finding\nartifacts in the input data, which requires both availability of a data set and\nhuman supervision. In this paper, we introduce DORA (Data-agnOstic\nRepresentation Analysis): the first data-agnostic framework for the analysis of\nthe representation space of DNNs. We propose a novel distance measure between\nrepresentations that utilizes self-explaining capabilities within the network\nitself without access to any data and quantitatively validate its alignment\nwith human-defined semantic distances.

The\npaper features an overview of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and extensions\nto account for partial observability and adversarial behavior. These models\nsufficiently capture aleatoric uncertainty but fail to account for epistemic\nuncertainty robustly. Consequently, we present a thorough overview of so-called\nuncertainty models that exhibit uncertainty in a more robust interpretation. We\nshow several solution techniques for both discrete and continuous models,\nranging from formal verification, over control-based abstractions, to\nreinforcement learning. As an integral part of this paper, we list and discuss\nseveral key challenges that arise when dealing with rich types of uncertainty\nin a model-based fashion.\n","authors":["Thom Badings","Thiago D.

Short-term intraday trading becomes increasingly important due to\nthe higher penetration of renewables. In Germany, the intraday electricity\nprice typically fluctuates around the day-ahead price of the European Power\nEXchange (EPEX) spot markets in a distinct hourly pattern. This work proposes a\nprobabilistic modeling approach that models the intraday price difference to\nthe day-ahead contracts. The model captures the emerging hourly pattern by\nconsidering the four 15 min intervals in each day-ahead price interval as a\nfour-dimensional joint probability distribution. The resulting nontrivial,\nmultivariate price difference distribution is learned using a normalizing flow,\ni.e., a deep generative model that combines conditional multivariate density\nestimation and probabilistic regression. Furthermore, this work discusses the\ninfluence of different external impact factors based on literature insights and\nimpact analysis using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The\nnormalizing flow is compared to an informed selection of historical data and\nprobabilistic forecasts using a Gaussian copula and a Gaussian regression\nmodel. Among the different models, the normalizing flow identifies the trends\nwith the highest accuracy and has the narrowest prediction intervals.

To address this need, many methods have\nbeen developed to synthetically induce gray matter (GM) atrophy in an MRI via\ndeformable registration, creating a set of images with known changes in\ncortical thickness. However, these methods often cause blurring in atrophied\nregions, and cannot simulate realistic atrophy within deep sulci where\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is obscured or absent. In this paper, we present a\nsolution using a self-supervised inpainting model to generate CSF in these\nregions and create images with more plausible GM/CSF boundaries. Specifically,\nwe introduce a novel, 3D GAN model that incorporates patch-based dropout\ntraining, edge map priors, and sinusoidal positional encoding, all of which are\nestablished methods previously limited to 2D domains.

With an objective to tune a specific component of a DBMS (e.g.,\nindex selection, knobs tuning), the ML-based tuning agents have shown to be\nable to find better configurations than experienced database administrators.\nHowever, one critical yet challenging question remains unexplored -- how to\nmake those ML-based tuning agents work collaboratively. Existing methods do not\nconsider the dependencies among the multiple agents, and the model used by each\nagent only studies the effect of changing the configurations in a single\ncomponent. To tune different components for DBMS, a coordinating mechanism is\nneeded to make the multiple agents cognizant of each other. Also, we need to\ndecide how to allocate the limited tuning budget among the agents to maximize\nthe performance. Such a decision is difficult to make since the distribution of\nthe reward for each agent is unknown and non-stationary. In this paper, we\nstudy the above question and present a unified coordinating framework to\nefficiently utilize existing ML-based agents.

This study\ninvestigates how to measure, evaluate, and enhance prediction fairness between\ndisadvantaged and privileged communities in spatial-temporal demand forecasting\nof ride-hailing services. A two-pronged approach is taken to reduce the demand\nprediction bias. First, we develop a novel deep learning model architecture,\nnamed socially aware neural network (SA-Net), to integrate the\nsocio-demographics and ridership information for fair demand prediction through\nan innovative socially-aware convolution operation.

One of the\nmain challenges of ES is that calculating the mutual information requires\ncomputationally-costly approximation techniques.

For example, an image released during the 2022\nworld cup depicts the famous soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo\nplaying chess, which playfully violates our expectation that their competition\nshould occur on the football field. Humans can easily recognize and interpret\nthese unconventional images, but can AI models do the same? We introduce\nWHOOPS!, a new dataset and benchmark for visual commonsense.

We consider several\ntasks posed over the dataset. In addition to image captioning, cross-modal\nmatching, and visual question answering, we introduce a difficult explanation\ngeneration task, where models must identify and explain why a given image is\nunusual. Our results show that state-of-the-art models such as GPT3 and BLIP2\nstill lag behind human performance on WHOOPS!.

A parameter-efficient adaptation method\nsuggests training an adapter for each domain on the task of language modeling.\nThis leads to good in-domain scores but can be impractical for domain- or\nresource-restricted settings. A solution is to use a related-domain adapter for\nthe novel domain at test time. In this paper, we introduce AdapterSoup, an\napproach that performs weight-space averaging of adapters trained on different\ndomains. Our approach is embarrassingly parallel: first, we train a set of\ndomain-specific adapters; then, for each novel domain, we determine which\nadapters should be averaged at test time. We present extensive experiments\nshowing that AdapterSoup consistently improves performance to new domains\nwithout extra training. We also explore weight averaging of adapters trained on\nthe same domain with different hyper-parameters, and show that it preserves the\nperformance of a PLM on new domains while obtaining strong in-domain results.\nWe explore various approaches for choosing which adapters to combine, such as\ntext clustering and semantic similarity.

It is\nespecially important to adhere to pre-approved terminology and adapt to\ncorrected translations in domain-specific projects. Machine translation (MT)\nhas achieved significant progress in the area of domain adaptation. However,\nreal-time adaptation remains challenging. Large-scale language models (LLMs)\nhave recently shown interesting capabilities of in-context learning, where they\nlearn to replicate certain input-output text generation patterns, without\nfurther fine-tuning. By feeding an LLM at inference time with a prompt that\nconsists of a list of translation pairs, it can then simulate the domain and\nstyle characteristics. This work aims to investigate how we can utilize\nin-context learning to improve real-time adaptive MT. Our extensive experiments\nshow promising results at translation time. For example, GPT-3.5 can adapt to a\nset of in-domain sentence pairs and/or terminology while translating a new\nsentence. We observe that the translation quality with few-shot in-context\nlearning can surpass that of strong encoder-decoder MT systems, especially for\nhigh-resource languages.

Traditional CIL models are trained from scratch to\ncontinually acquire knowledge as data evolves. Recently, pre-training has\nachieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible\nfor CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable\nembeddings, which can be easily transferred. In this work, we revisit CIL with\nPTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model updating\nand generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal that frozen\nPTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL. Surprisingly, a\nsimple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the classifiers of PTM to\nprototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without training on the\ndownstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between pre-trained and\ndownstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with adaptivity via model\nadapting. We propose ADapt And Merge (ADAM), which aggregates the embeddings of\nPTM and adapted models for classifier construction. ADAM is a general framework\nthat can be orthogonally combined with any parameter-efficient tuning method,\nwhich holds the advantages of PTM's generalizability and adapted model's\nadaptivity. 3) Additionally, we find previous benchmarks are unsuitable in the\nera of PTM due to data overlapping and propose four new benchmarks for\nassessment, namely ImageNet-A, ObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB.

In this paper, we propose a simpler\napproach: learn a hyperbolic embedding of the input, then map once from it to\nEuclidean space using a mapping that encodes geometric priors by respecting the\nisometries of hyperbolic space, and finish with a standard Euclidean network.\nThe key insight is to use a random feature mapping via the eigenfunctions of\nthe Laplace operator, which we show can approximate any isometry-invariant\nkernel on hyperbolic space. Our method can be used together with any graph\nneural networks: using even a linear graph model yields significant\nimprovements in both efficiency and performance over other hyperbolic baselines\nin both transductive and inductive tasks.\n","authors":["Tao Yu","Christopher De Sa"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06854v3.pdf","comment":"ICLR 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03241v2","updated":"2023-03-13T17:43:16Z","published":"2022-12-06T18:59:58Z","title":"PØDA: Prompt-driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation","summary":"  Domain adaptation has been vastly investigated in computer vision but still\nrequires access to target images at train time, which might be intractable in\nsome uncommon conditions.

Over the past two decades,\nthere has been a fundamental shift in the trend of MI-EEG classifiers,\nresulting in a gradual increase in their performance. The emergence of\nTensor-CSPNet, the first geometric deep learning (GDL) framework in BCI\nresearch, is attributed to the imperative of characterizing the non-Euclidean\nnature of signals. Fundamentally, Tensor-CSPNet is a deep learning-based\nclassifier that capitalizes on the second-order statistics of EEGs. In contrast\nto the conventional approach of utilizing first-order statistics for EEG\nsignals, the utilization of these second-order statistics represents the\nclassical treatment. These statistics provide adequate discriminative\ninformation, rendering them suitable for MI-EEG classification. In this study,\nwe introduce another GDL classifier, called Graph-CSPNet, for MI-EEG\nclassification. Graph-CSPNet utilizes graph-based techniques to characterize\nEEG signals in both the time and frequency domains, realizing the fundamental\nperspective of time-frequency analysis. The architecture of Graph-CSPNet is\nfurther simplified, offering greater flexibility to cope with variable\ntime-frequency resolution for signal segmentation and capturing localized\nfluctuations. In contrast to Tensor-CSPNet, this approach enables Graph-CSPNet\nto achieve better results in MI-EEG classification. To evaluate the efficacy of\nGraph-CSPNet, we utilize five commonly-used publicly available MI-EEG datasets,\nand it produces near-optimal classification accuracies, winning nine out of\neleven subject-specific scenarios.

In\nthis work, we present a unifying view of existing MI bounds from the\nperspective of importance sampling, and propose three novel bounds based on\nthis approach. Since accurate estimation of MI without density information\nrequires a sample size exponential in the true MI, we assume either a single\nmarginal or the full joint density information is known.

However, even the most accurate NNs can be biased\ntoward a specific output classification due to the inherent bias in the\navailable training datasets, which may propagate to the real-world\nimplementations. This paper deals with the robustness bias, i.e., the bias\nexhibited by the trained NN by having a significantly large robustness to noise\nfor a certain output class, as compared to the remaining output classes. The\nbias is shown to result from imbalanced datasets, i.e., the datasets where all\noutput classes are not equally represented. Towards this, we propose the\nUnbiasedNets framework, which leverages K-means clustering and the NN's noise\ntolerance to diversify the given training dataset, even from relatively smaller\ndatasets. This generates balanced datasets and reduces the bias within the\ndatasets themselves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework\ncatering to the robustness bias problem in NNs. We use real-world datasets to\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the UnbiasedNets for data diversification, in case\nof both binary and multi-label classifiers. The results are compared to\nwell-known tools aimed at generating balanced datasets, and illustrate how\nexisting works have limited success while addressing the robustness bias.

Our main contribution is proving novel generalization bounds in\ntwo such settings, one linear, and one non-linear. We study the linear\nclassification setting of Nagarajan and Kolter, and a quadratic ground truth\nfunction learned via a two-layer neural network in the non-linear regime.

UEs are training samples added with\ninvisible but unlearnable noise, which have been found can prevent unauthorized\ntraining of machine learning models. UEs typically are generated via a bilevel\noptimization framework with a surrogate model to remove (minimize) errors from\nthe original samples, and then applied to protect the data against unknown\ntarget models. However, existing UE generation methods all rely on an ideal\nassumption called label-consistency, where the hackers and protectors are\nassumed to hold the same label for a given sample. In this work, we propose and\npromote a more practical label-agnostic setting, where the hackers may exploit\nthe protected data quite differently from the protectors. E.g., a m-class\nunlearnable dataset held by the protector may be exploited by the hacker as a\nn-class dataset. Existing UE generation methods are rendered ineffective in\nthis challenging setting.

Existing studies on provider fairness usually focused on\ndesigning proportion fairness (PF) metrics that first consider systematic\nfairness. However, sociological researches show that to make the market more\nstable, max-min fairness (MMF) is a better metric. The main reason is that MMF\naims to improve the utility of the worst ones preferentially, guiding the\nsystem to support the providers in weak market positions. When applying MMF to\nrecommender systems, how to balance user preferences and provider fairness in\nan online recommendation scenario is still a challenging problem. In this\npaper, we proposed an online re-ranking model named Provider Max-min Fairness\nRe-ranking (P-MMF) to tackle the problem. Specifically, P-MMF formulates\nprovider fair recommendation as a resource allocation problem, where the\nexposure slots are considered the resources to be allocated to providers and\nthe max-min fairness is used as the regularizer during the process. We show\nthat the problem can be further represented as a regularized online optimizing\nproblem and solved efficiently in its dual space.

Existing recommendation datasets, such as Amazon Product\nReviews and MovieLens, greatly facilitated the research and development of\nrecommender systems in their respective domains. While the number of mobile\nusers and applications (aka apps) has increased exponentially over the past\ndecade, research in mobile app recommender systems has been significantly\nconstrained, primarily due to the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, as\nopposed to recommendations for products, movies, and news. To facilitate\nresearch for app recommendation systems, we introduce a large-scale dataset,\ncalled MobileRec. We constructed MobileRec from users' activity on the Google\nplay store. MobileRec contains 19.3 million user interactions (i.e., user\nreviews on apps) with over 10K unique apps across 48 categories. MobileRec\nrecords the sequential activity of a total of 0.7 million distinct users. Each\nof these users has interacted with no fewer than five distinct apps, which\nstands in contrast to previous datasets on mobile apps that recorded only a\nsingle interaction per user. Furthermore, MobileRec presents users' ratings as\nwell as sentiments on installed apps, and each app contains rich metadata such\nas app name, category, description, and overall rating, among others. We\ndemonstrate that MobileRec can serve as an excellent testbed for app\nrecommendation through a comparative study of several state-of-the-art\nrecommendation approaches.

In this work, we propose\na new framework, PPrior, that enables proactive prioritization of app issues\nthrough identifying prominent reviews (ones predicted to receive a large number\nof votes in a given time window). Predicting highly-voted reviews is\nchallenging given that, unlike social posts, social network features of users\nare not available. Moreover, there is an issue of class imbalance, since a\nlarge number of user reviews receive little to no votes. PPrior employs a\npre-trained T5 model and works in three phases. Phase one adapts the\npre-trained T5 model to the user reviews data in a self-supervised fashion.

In this work, we\ninvestigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of\nthe attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each\nattention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model\nsharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and\ntasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability,\nwhich can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the\npathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated\nattention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose\n$\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all\nlinear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed reparameterization successfully prevents entropy\ncollapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally,\nwe prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases\nexponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing\nadditional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with\n$\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning,\nmachine translation, automatic speech recognition, and language modeling tasks,\nacross Transformer architectures.

However, it requires massive\ntask-specific data, which may not be plausible in many real-world applications.\nData augmentation methods such as representation interpolation, token\nreplacement, or augmentation with models are applied to tackle this problem.\nHowever, these data augmentation methods either potentially cause shifts in\ndecision boundaries (representation interpolation), are not expressive enough\n(token replacement), or introduce too much computational overhead (augmentation\nwith models). To this end, we propose AugPro (Augmentation with Projection), an\neffective and efficient data augmentation method for distillation. Our method\nbuilds on top of representation interpolation augmentation methods to maintain\nthe diversity of expressions and converts the augmented data to tokens to avoid\nshifting decision boundaries. It uses simple operations that come with little\ncomputational overhead.

In theory (assuming bounded range and precision), this limits\ntheir formal language recognition power to regular languages, and in practice,\nRNNs have been shown to be unable to learn many context-free languages (CFLs).\nIn order to expand the class of languages RNNs recognize, prior work has\naugmented RNNs with a nondeterministic stack data structure, putting them on\npar with pushdown automata and increasing their language recognition power to\nCFLs. Nondeterminism is needed for recognizing all CFLs (not just deterministic\nCFLs), but in this paper, we show that nondeterminism and the neural controller\ninteract to produce two more unexpected abilities. First, the nondeterministic\nstack RNN can recognize not only CFLs, but also many non-context-free\nlanguages. Second, it can recognize languages with much larger alphabet sizes\nthan one might expect given the size of its stack alphabet. Finally, to\nincrease the information capacity in the stack and allow it to solve more\ncomplicated tasks with large alphabet sizes, we propose a new version of the\nnondeterministic stack that simulates stacks of vectors rather than discrete\nsymbols.
